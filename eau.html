<b>Codelaw</b> evolves the law. Current law (of a country, nation or company) written by a natural language is a huge legacy cost of governance of human being. It's difficult to trace its logics, avoid conflicts and be updated. Natural Language Laws (NL-laws) are made to be effective of 100 people village, but not 1 billion nation where criminal cases are uncountable. Computer programmers, on the other hand, has solved the same problem in a different way: software. Codelaw is a project to manage laws of human being by transporting cultures of computer programming. This project aims to create a model and platform to enable naive programmers to create laws. These laws includes debuggers, compilers, and will be manged on git, github. It may be connected IoTs to detect criminals without human eyes. The law even throws exceptions to juries where human mind is beyond the law.</p>
