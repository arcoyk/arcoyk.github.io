<b>Chef's Hippocampus</b>
</p>

<p>Chef's Hippocumpas is a project to generate "good and new" collections of ingredient from a database. Our system value creavity by average and SD of distance of the collection.
</p>

<p>Human brain is good at capture creativity or capture patterns behind complex relationships. However, human working memory is bad (it is said that we're capable of having only 8 numbers at a time). This fact suggests there are millions of good combination that we just cloudn't sum up.
</p>

<p>
This project aim to enhance human creativity using computational creativity. The input of this system is a dataset which contains exisiting collection of items. The output is a "new and good" collection. The system is backed with a simple equation of "creativity" applied NLP algorithm called Word2Vec.
</p>

<p><b>What is Creativity</b></p>

<p>"Creativity" is not commonly defined. We have a big discussion. However, many researchers agreed something is "creative" when it is "good" and "new". This system measures creativity based on average (for how good) and stadard deviation (for how new).
</p>

<p>The system requires data. A huge data. We used recipe database. Recipe database can be seen as a good collection of ingedients because bad collections should have been ommitted in the long history of cuisine.
</p>

<p>Then it counts how many times two ingredients come up in a recipe. This count is a measure the distance between the ingredients.
</p>

<p>If you simply want a good collection, average of the distance is useful. If it's low, they're close each other.</p>

<p>However, we want more interesting combination of food.If we collects close distant ingredients, they might go well, but not interesting. If we add far distant food as its interesiting part, then the harmoney will be disrupted.
</p>

<p>The system also think about SD of the distances. SD imples the distribution of the distances. High SD means the collection has low distant ingredients and high distant ingredients as well.
</p>

<p>Lastly, it suggests collections with low average and high SD of distnace. This means, the collection contains ingredients that distant while maintaining the harmoney as a whole.
</p>

<p>
<b>How to Compute Food</b>
</p>

<p>
Thanks to the NLP advances, we have a powerful tool to caliculate one ingredient to another. Word2Vec is an technique to "vectorize" a word in a text. If you input a long text, Word2Vec create a vector (like [0.0, 0.1, 0.4, 0.2, 0.4]) that represent the word. Using it, we can caliculate words. For example, "king" - "man" + "woman" = "Queen". Here we can caliculate the distance between words by caliculating the distance of between vectors (see CosineSimilarity).
</p>

<p>
We applied Word2Vec to recipes. Recipe is the text, and each ingredients are word. We took cosine similarity as the distance of ingredients.
</p>

<p>
<b>Extension</b>
</p>

<p>
The idea of Chef's Hippocampus is applicable to various collections such as colors, clothes and items, interiors, where human counting is behind of the possible combination.

<b>How Can I Use It?</b>
</p>

<p>
Thank you for being interested, but the project has been suspended as we decided the project will not meet grant's goal. If you have a bigdata <a href="/">send me a message.</a></p>
