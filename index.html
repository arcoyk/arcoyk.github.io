	I'm a researcher and designer with a backgorund of Computer Science and Augmented Reality. 
	My research focuses on Human Computer Interaction, 
	Human Augmentation, and my interests include introducing new methods for 
	enhancement of human creativity with computational support. I enjoy swimming, cooking and competitive programming as hobby.

<b>Chef's Hippocumpas</b>
:Chef's Hippocumpas is a project to generate "new and good" collections of ingredient from a database of good collection of ingredient. This project aim to enhance human creativity using computational creativity. As a system, it applies NLP algorithm to food comparison (Word2Vec), measures "creativity" of a collection by a simple equasion.

<p>
<b>Programmable Food</b>
:Programmable Food is a concept that makes food programmable to realize richer experiences 
of fine dinning. As the first step, MIDAS FORK enables chefs to program transition of tastes 
such as bitter to sweet or sweet to bitter. The system consists of a programming interface 
and computationally enhanced cutlery. Chefs can program the transition of tastes in advance, 
and the cutlery seasons foods by shooting seasonings using sensing and pumping mechanism.

<b>DEEP LOOK: Dynamic Focus Interactions</b>
:This system adds a dynamic focus interaction on a picture to provide a depth perception of 
the image. The system makes layers of viewer's gaze point to be in the focus, others out of 
the focus using a gaze tracker and image processing algorithm. Through this system, a Monet's 
painting turns from a static image into dynamic 3D image, or an complex subway map emphasizes 
the focusing lines as if they are floating on the other lines. The system is applicable for a 
novel art gallery, education or general guidance.
