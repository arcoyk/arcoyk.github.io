Hey, fuck him.</br>

<p>
I'm the senior broker here.</br>He's just a worthless piker.</br>

<p>
Why don't you blow me, Hanna?</br>

<p>
Now did you really pitch a stock</br>in your job interview?</br>
</p>
<p>
I had to do something to stand out.</br>Right, sir?</br>
</p>
<p>
I fucking love that.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Lunch. Today.</br>- Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
We don't start dialing at 9:30</br>

Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for you</br>on this glorious afternoon?</br>
</p>
<p>
Well, Hector, here's the game plan.</br>
</p>
<p>
You're gonna bring us</br>two Absolut martinis.</br>
</p>
<span>

</p>
<span>
  Howl = 遠吠え。
</span>
<p>
And then precisely seven</br>and one half minutes after that,</br>
</p>
<p>
you're gonna bring us two more.</br>
</p>
<p>
Then two more after that</br>every five minutes</br>
</p>
<p>
until one of us</br>passes the fuck out.</br>
</p>
<span>
  pass out = 気を失う
</span>
<p>
Excellent strategy, sir.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm good with water for now.</br>
</p>
<p>
Thank you.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's his first day on Wall Street.</br>Give him time.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Thank you.</br>- Thank you.</br>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Hanna?</br>
</p>
<p>
You're able to do</br>drugs during the day</br>
</p>
<p>
and then still function,</br>still do your job?</br>
</p>
<p>
How the fuck else would</br>you do this job?</br>
</p>
<p>
Cocaine and hookers, my friend.</br>
</p>
<p>
Right.</br>
</p>
<p>
Well, I got to say,</br>I'm incredibly excited</br>
</p>
<p>
to be a part of your firm.</br>I mean...</br>
</p>
<p>
The clients you have</br>are absolutely...</br>

<p>
Move the money from your client's</br>pocket into your pocket.</br>
</p>
<p>
Right.</br>
</p>
<p>
But if you make your clients money</br>at the same time,</br>
</p>
<p>
it's advantageous to</br>everyone. Correct?</br>

<p>
Nobody knows if a</br>stock is gonna go up,</br>
</p>
<p>
down, sideways,</br>or in fucking circles.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Least of all stockbrokers, right?</br>- Mmm-hmm.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's all a fugazi.</br>You know what a fugazi is?</br>
</p>
<span>
  fugazi = うそ
</span>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<span>
  whazy = hazy? = haze = もや<br>
  woozy = （頭の）くらくら
</span>
<p>
Fairy dust. It doesn't exist.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's never landed. It is no matter.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's not on the elemental chart.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's not fucking real.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Right?</br>- Right.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Stay with me.</br>- Mmm-hmm.</br>
</p>
<p>
We don't create shit.</br>We don't build anything.</br>
</p>
<p>
No.</br>
</p>
<p>
So if you got a client</br>who bought stock at 8</br>
</p>
<p>
and it now sits at 16,</br>he's all fucking happy.</br>
</p>
<p>
He wants to cash in, liquidate,</br>
</p>
<span>
  liquidate = 流動化する = 現金にする
</span>
<p>
take his fucking</br>money and run home.</br>
</p>
<p>
- You don't let him do that.</br>- Okay.</br>
</p>
<p>
- 'Cause that would make it real.</br>- Right.</br>
</p>
<p>
No. What do you do?</br>
</p>
<p>
You get another brilliant idea.</br>
</p>
<p>
A special idea.</br>
</p>
<p>
Another "situation." Another stock</br>
</p>
<p>
to reinvest his</br>earnings and then some.</br>
</p>
<p>
And he will, every single time.</br>
</p>
<p>
'Cause they're fucking addicted.</br>
</p>
<p>
And you just keep doing this,</br>again and again and again.</br>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile,</br>he thinks he's getting shit rich,</br>
</p>
<p>
which he is, on paper.</br>
</p>
<p>
But you and me, the brokers,</br>
</p>
<p>
we're taking home cold hard cash</br>
</p>
<p>
via commission, motherfucker.</br>
</p>
<p>
Right.</br>
</p>
<p>
That's incredible, sir.</br>
</p>
<p>
I can't tell you how excited I am.</br>
</p>
<p>
You should be.</br>
</p>
<p>
There's two keys to success</br>in the broker business.</br>
</p>
<p>
First of all...</br>
</p>
<p>
- You gotta stay relaxed.</br>- Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
Do you jerk off?</br>
</p>
<p>
Do I... Do I jerk off?</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah. Yeah, I jerk off. Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
How many times a week?</br>
</p>
<p>
Like, um, three or four.</br>
</p>
<p>
Three or four times, maybe five.</br>
</p>
<p>
Gotta pump those numbers up.</br>
</p>
<p>
Those are rookie numbers</br>in this racket.</br>
</p>
<span>
  rookie = 新兵<br>
  racket = protection racket(?) = とりたて(ex. run a protection racket)
</span>
<p>
I myself, I jerk off</br>at least twice a day.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Wow.</br>- Once in the morning</br>
</p>
<p>
right after I work out,</br>then once right after lunch.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Really?</br>- Mmm-hmm.</br>
</p>
<p>
I want to. That's not why I do it.</br>
</p>
<p>
I do it 'cause I fucking need to.</br>
</p>
<p>
Think about it.</br>You're dealing with numbers.</br>
</p>
<p>
All day long,</br>decimal points, high frequencies.</br>
</p>
<p>
Bang, bang, bang.</br>
</p>
<p>
Fucking digits.</br>
</p>
<p>
All very acidic</br>above-the-shoulders mustard shit.</br>
</p>
<p>
- All right?</br>- Mmm-hmm.</br>
</p>
<p>
It kind of wigs some people out.</br>
</p>
<span>
  wig out = 麻薬に酔う = だめになる(?)
</span>
<p>
- Mmm-hmm.</br>- Right.</br>
</p>
<p>
You got to feed the geese</br>to keep the blood flowing.</br>
</p>
<span>
  feed the geese = masterbate
</span>
<p>
Mmm-hmm.</br>
</p>
<p>
I keep the rhythm below the belt.</br>
</p>
<p>
Done.</br>
</p>
<p>
This is not a tip, this</br>is a prescription.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Trust me.</br>- Mmm-hmm.</br>
</p>
<p>
If you don't, you will</br>fall out of balance,</br>
</p>
<p>
split your differential</br>and tip the fuck over.</br>
</p>
<span>
  split diffferential and tip = ?
</span>
<p>
Or worse yet,</br>
</p>
<p>
I've seen this happen, implode.</br>
</p>
<span>
  implode = 崩壊（内破）explodeは外に被害が出るが、implodeはcollapseに近く、建物の崩壊など。
</span>
<p>
No, I don't want to implode, sir.</br>
</p>
<p>
No. No, you don't.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm in it for the</br>long run, you know?</br>
</p>
<p>
- Implosions are ugly.</br>- Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
Pop off to the bathroom,</br>work one out any time you can.</br>
</p>
<span>
  Pop off = そっとでていく
</span>
<p>
When you get really good at it,</br>
</p>
<p>
you'll fucking be stroking it</br>and you'll be thinking about money.</br>
</p>
<p>
Second key to success</br>in this racket</br>
</p>
<p>
is this little baby right here.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's called cocaine.</br>
</p>
<span>
  コカイン＝コカノキから抽出できるアルカロイド。麻酔・依存性のある麻薬。<br>
  アルカロイド=植物中に存在し窒素を含む塩基性化合物の総称。殺虫剤や向精神薬など。カフェイン、コカイン、テオブロミン、テトロドトキシン、ドーパミン、ニコチン、モルヒネなど。
</span>
<p>
Right.</br>
</p>
<p>
It'll keep you sharp</br>between the ears.</br>
</p>
<p>
It'll also help your</br>fingers dial faster.</br>
</p>
<p>
And guess what?</br>
</p>
<p>
That's good for me.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yes, sir.</br>
</p>
<p>
Revolutions. You follow?</br>
</p>
<p>
Revolutions.</br>
</p>
<p>
Keep the clients on</br>the Ferris wheel.</br>
</p>
<span>
  the Ferries wheel = 観覧車。発明者の名前から。
</span>
<p>
And it goes. The park</br>is open 24/7, 365,</br>
</p>
<p>
every decade, every</br>goddamn century.</br>
</p>
<p>
That's it.</br>
</p>
<p>
The name of the game.</br>

</p>
<span>

</span>

- Two hours ago.</br>- Right.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
They're up and comers.</br>That's what that means.</br>

<p>
What's your name again?</br>
</p>
<p>
Mine... Jordan Belfort.</br>
</p>
<p>
Jordan, what do you get</br>on that blue chip stock?</br>
</p>
<p>
I make one percent.</br>Or I did make one percent.</br>
</p>
<p>
Pink sheets, it's 50.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's 50%?</br>
</p>
<p>
50% commission?</br>
</p>
<p>
- Yup.</br>- For what?</br>
</p>
<p>
It's our markup for our services.</br>
</p>
<p>
And so if I... If I...</br>
</p>
<p>
if I sell a stock at $10,000,</br>my commission is 5,000 bucks?</br>
</p>
<p>
If you sell $10,000</br>worth of this stock,</br>
</p>
<p>
I will personally give you</br>a blowjob for free.</br>
</p>
<p>
And I hope it happens.</br>

<p>
<i>Hello, John,</br>how are you doing today?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
You mailed in my company</br>a postcard a few weeks back</br>
</p>
<p>
requesting information</br>on penny stocks</br>
</p>
<p>
that had huge upside potential</br>
</p>
<p>
with very little downside risk.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Does that ring a bell?</br><i>- Yeah, I may have sent something.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Okay, great. The reason for</br>the call today, John, is,</br>
</p>
<p>
something just came</br>across my desk, John.</br>
</p>
<p>
It is perhaps the best thing</br>
</p>
<p>
I've seen in the last six months.</br>
</p>
<p>
If you have 60 seconds,</br>I'd like to share</br>
</p>
<p>
the idea with you.</br>You got a minute?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Actually, I'm really very...</i></br>
</p>
<p>
The name of the company,</br>Aerotyne International.</br>
</p>
<p>
It is a cutting edge high-tech firm</br>out of the Midwest</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>awaiting imminent patent approval</i></br>
</p>
<p>
on the next generation</br>of radar detectors</br>
</p>
<p>
that have both huge military</br>and civilian applications now.</br>
</p>
<p>
Right now, John,</br>
</p>
<p>
the stock trades over-the-counter</br>at 10 cents a share.</br>
</p>
<p>
And by the way, John,</br>our analysts indicate</br>
</p>
<p>
it could go a heck of</br>a lot higher than that.</br>
</p>
<p>
Your profit on a mere</br>$6,000 investment</br>
</p>
<p>
would be upwards of $60,000!</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Jesus! That's my mortgage, man.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Exactly.</br>You could pay off your mortgage.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>This stock will pay off my house?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
John, one thing I can promise you,</br>
</p>
<p>
even in this market,</br>
</p>
<p>
is that I never ask my clients</br>
</p>
<p>
to judge me on my winners.</br>
</p>
<p>
I ask them to judge me on my losers</br>because I have so few.</br>
</p>
<p>
And in the case of Aerotyne,</br>
</p>
<p>
based on every technical</br>factor out there, John,</br>
</p>
<p>
we are looking at</br>a grand slam home run.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Okay, let's do it. I'll do 4 grand.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
$4,000? That'd be</br>40,000 shares, John.</br>
</p>
<p>
Let me lock in that trade right now</br>
</p>
<p>
and get back to you</br>with my secretary</br>
</p>
<p>
with an exact confirmation.</br>Sound good, John?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>- Yeah, sounds good.</i></br>- Great.</br>
</p>
<p>
Hey, John.</br>
</p>
<p>
Thank you for your</br>vote of confidence.</br>
</p>
<p>
And welcome to the</br>Investor's Center.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Yeah, thanks a lot, man.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Bye-bye.</br>
</p>
<p>
How'd you fucking do that?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Just like that, I made 2 grand.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>The other guys looked at me</br>like I'd just discovered fire.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Great! Even better!</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I was selling garbage</br>to garbage men</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>and making cash hand over fist.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
The only problem you're gonna</br>have is that you didn't buy more.</br>
</p>
<p>
Boom shocka locka!</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>So I was selling them shit.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>But the way I looked at it, their</br>money was better off in my pocket.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I knew how to spend it better.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Excuse me.</br>Is that your car in the lot?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>- It's a nice ride.</br>- Thanks, man.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Donnie Azoff.</br>
</p>
<p>
Hey. I'm Jordan Belfort.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Nice to meet you.</br>- How you doing?</br>
</p>
<p>
You know, actually,</br>I see that car around.</br>
</p>
<p>
- I see it around a lot.</br>- Oh, yeah, where?</br>
</p>
<p>
I think we live in</br>the same building.</br>
</p>
<p>
- No shit?</br>- Yeah, yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Twelfth floor?</br>- Yeah. What floor are you on?</br>
</p>
<p>
Fourth floor.</br>
</p>
<p>
- I have two little kids. Ugly wife.</br>- Right.</br>
</p>
<p>
What do you do, bro?</br>
</p>
<p>
What do you mean, what do I do?</br>
</p>
<p>
For work, what do you do?</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm a stockbroker.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Stockbroker?</br>- Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
Children's furniture.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, good for you.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's all right.</br>
</p>
<p>
You make a lot of money?</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, I do all right for myself.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm trying to put it together.</br>
</p>
<p>
You got your fucking nice car,</br>
</p>
<p>
we live in the same</br>building. I just...</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm not understanding...</br>How much money do you make?</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't know. $70,000 last month.</br>
</p>
<p>
Get the fuck...</br>
</p>
<p>
Get the fuck out of here.</br>
</p>
<p>
No, I'm serious.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, no, I'm serious, too.</br>
</p>
<p>
Seriously,</br>how much money do you make?</br>
</p>
<p>
I told you. $70,000.</br>
</p>
<p>
Well, technically, $72,000.</br>
</p>
<p>
Last month. Something like that.</br>
</p>
<p>
You made 72 grand in one month?</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'll tell you what.</br>
</p>
<p>
You show me a pay stub</br>for $72,000 on it,</br>
</p>
<p>
I quit my job right now</br>and I work for you.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Hey, Paulie, what's up?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
No, yeah, yeah.</br>No, everything's fine.</br>
</p>
<p>
Hey, listen, I quit.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>And he did quit his job.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Which I thought was a little weird.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I mean, I just met</br>this fucking guy.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Don't fucking tell Susan.</br>It's none of her business.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>There were other</br>things about him, too.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Like his phosphorescent</br>white teeth.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
wife! I gotta fucking</br>deal with your wife?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>The fact that he wore horn rims</br>with clear lenses</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>just to look more WASP-y.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>And then, there were these rumors.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
I heard some stupid shit.</br>I don't know.</br>
</p>
<p>
Fuck, I didn't even want</br>to bring it up. It's just...</br>
</p>
<p>
- it's stupid.</br>- Shit with me?</br>
</p>
<p>
You know, people say shit.</br>I don't even know.</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't even listen</br>to it half the time.</br>
</p>
<p>
What are they saying?</br>
</p>
<p>
Shit about you and your cousin</br>or something like that.</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't even listen to it.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, bro, it's not like that.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's not like that.</br>
</p>
<p>
Like you married your cousin</br>or some stupid shit. No?</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, my wife. Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
My wife is my cousin, or whatever.</br>
</p>
<p>
But it's not like what you think,</br>or whatever, you know.</br>
</p>
<p>
Is she like a first</br>cousin, or is she...</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, no, she's, you know...</br>
</p>
<p>
Her... Her father</br>
</p>
<p>
is the brother of my mom.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's not like, what... You know.</br>
</p>
<p>
Look, we grew up together.</br>
</p>
<p>
And she grew up hot, you know.</br>She fucking grew up hot.</br>
</p>
<p>
And all my friends were</br>trying to fuck her, you know.</br>
</p>
<p>
And I'm not gonna let someone...</br>
</p>
<p>
You know, one of these</br>assholes fuck my cousin,</br>
</p>
<p>
so, you know, I used</br>the cousin thing</br>
</p>
<p>
as like an in with her.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm not gonna let someone</br>else fuck my cousin.</br>
</p>
<p>
You know,</br>if anyone's gonna fuck my cousin,</br>
</p>
<p>
it's gonna be me, out of respect.</br>You know?</br>
</p>
<p>
No, I get it. Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
I mean, you're not afraid of</br>like the whole kid thing, right?</br>
</p>
<p>
- What? Having kids with her?</br>- Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
No. We have two kids.</br>
</p>
<p>
And they're... I mean...</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't want to get personal,</br>but they're okay?</br>
</p>
<p>
No, they're not retarded</br>or anything like that.</br>
</p>
<p>
But there's a big</br>chance, right, if...</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, there's like a 60%, you know,</br>
</p>
<p>
60 to 65% chance the kid's gonna</br>be fucking retarded or whatever.</br>
</p>
<p>
That'd scare the shit</br>out of me, buddy.</br>
</p>
<p>
Look, man, a lot of having a kid,</br>or whatever, takes risk,</br>
</p>
<p>
whether you're fucking</br>cousins or not.</br>
</p>
<p>
What if something</br>like that happened?</br>
</p>
<p>
Basically, you know,</br>if the kid was retarded,</br>
</p>
<p>
I would, you know,</br>drive it up to the country</br>
</p>
<p>
and just, like, you know,</br>open the door and say,</br>
</p>
<p>
"You're free now."</br>You know, like, "Run free."</br>
</p>
<p>
You know?</br>
</p>
<p>
You're completely fucking with me.</br>
</p>
<p>
That's horrible.</br>You're not gonna...</br>
</p>
<p>
You look like you've... No.</br>
</p>
<p>
We would take it to,</br>like, an institution or somewhere</br>
</p>
<p>
that's handled to, like, you know,</br>
</p>
<p>
raise the kid or whatever.</br>
</p>
<p>
You know what? If you're</br>happy, God bless you, buddy.</br>
</p>
<p>
No, I'm not fucking happy.</br>
</p>
<p>
No one who's married</br>is fucking happy.</br>
</p>
<p>
Well, I'm sorry to</br>hear that, buddy.</br>
</p>
<p>
Listen, I'm really, you know...</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm really appreciative</br>for this fucking job.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm really enjoying it.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm really happy with</br>what you're doing.</br>
</p>
<p>
Actually, I got you</br>a little present.</br>
</p>
<p>
- You got me a present?</br>- I got you something.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, fuck. You're sweet.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah. It's in the back though.</br>
</p>
<p>
- What do you mean?</br>- You gotta go out back.</br>
</p>
<p>
Like it's wrapped up or something?</br>
</p>
<p>
It's wrapped up. Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
- I don't get it.</br>- Neither do I.</br>
</p>
<p>
Let's fucking go. Come on.</br>
</p>
<p>
Your turn.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm not fucking doing this.</br>
</p>
<p>
You're out of your fucking mind.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Smoke this shit, bro.</br>- No.</br>
</p>
<p>
No one's fucking here, bro.</br>
</p>
<p>
Get the fuck...</br>
</p>
<p>
Fucking smoke crack with me, bro.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm not fucking doing it.</br>
</p>
<p>
Smoke crack. Smoke some</br>fucking crack with me, bro.</br>
</p>
<p>
- One hit. One hit. That's it.</br>- Okay.</br>
</p>
<p>
Fucking nut job.</br>
</p>
<p>
Wow!</br>
</p>
<p>
Wow.</br>
</p>
<p>
Let's go run, huh?</br>
</p>
<p>
We gotta get out of here, buddy.</br>
</p>
<p>
We gotta get out of here.</br>Let's go fucking run.</br>
</p>
<p>
Let's run like we're fucking lions</br>and tigers and bears!</br>
</p>
<p>
Let's run! Let's fucking run!</br>
</p>
<p>
Let's fucking run! Go!</br>

Go, go, go, go!</br>

<i>You've reached</br>Frank's Best Auto Body.</i></br>

<p>
<i>We're closed right now.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>So please leave us a message.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Hello. My name is Jordan Belfort.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>My partner and I are very interested</br>in renting out your garage.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Donnie and I were</br>going out on our own.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>And the first thing</br>we needed was brokers.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Guys with sales experience.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>So I recruited some</br>of my hometown boys.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Sea Otter, who sold meat</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>and weed.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Chester, who sold tires</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>and weed.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>And Robbie, who sold anything</br>he could get his hands on.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Mostly weed.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Can you bring me some ketchup?</br>Okay?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>This is Brad.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>And Brad's the guy</br>I really wanted.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>But he didn't go along with us.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>He was already making so much</br>money selling Quaaludes,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>he'd become the Quaalude king</br>of Bayside.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Getting any pussy</br>with that thing or what?</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, man, of course.</br>
</p>
<p>
Bring some of them chicks</br>around here sometime, huh?</br>
</p>
<p>
Let 'em watch.</br>
</p>
<p>
Let 'em watch. Know what I mean?</br>
</p>
<p>
Hey, Zip! You tell your sister</br>I was asking about her.</br>
</p>
<p>
Why don't you bring me a pair of her</br>panties next time you come through.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, man. She said she don't</br>want to talk to you anymore, man.</br>
</p>
<p>
Get the fuck out of here.</br>
</p>
<p>
Hey, Ma, we got chicken or what?</br>
</p>
<p>
Ma!</br>
</p>
<p>
You listening?</br>It's easier than you think.</br>
</p>
<p>
Every person you're</br>on the phone with,</br>
</p>
<p>
they want to get rich</br>and they want to get rich quickly.</br>
</p>
<p>
They all want something</br>for nothing.</br>
</p>
<p>
There was this one time that I was</br>selling pot to this Amish dude.</br>
</p>
<p>
You know those guys</br>who got like the beard</br>
</p>
<p>
with like no mustache</br>or some bullshit?</br>
</p>
<p>
Well, he says that he only</br>wants to make furniture.</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't understand.</br>
</p>
<p>
What's that</br>got to do with anything?</br>
</p>
<p>
What the fuck are</br>you talking about?</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm not putting words</br>in your mouth or nothing,</br>
</p>
<p>
but you just said that</br>everybody wants to get rich.</br>
</p>
<p>
Holy fuck, you did just say that.</br>
</p>
<p>
What the fuck are</br>you talking about?</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, like Buddhists.</br>
</p>
<p>
They don't give a shit about money.</br>
</p>
<p>
They're wrapped in sheets.</br>They're not buying shit.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm not talking about</br>Buddhists or Amish.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm talking about normal people,</br>
</p>
<p>
working-class, everyday people.</br>
</p>
<p>
Everyone wants to</br>get rich. Am I crazy?</br>
</p>
<p>
There's no such thing</br>as an Amish Buddhist.</br>
</p>
<p>
- I'm pretty fucking sure.</br>- There could be.</br>
</p>
<p>
Can we get some ketchup, please?</br>
</p>
<p>
Do you guys not want to make money?</br>
</p>
<p>
I want to make some money.</br>
</p>
<p>
I want to make some</br>fucking money, okay.</br>
</p>
<p>
I can sell anything.</br>
</p>
<p>
Shit, I can sell ludes</br>to a convent full of nuns,</br>
</p>
<p>
and get them so horny</br>they'd be fucking each other.</br>
</p>
<p>
That's the attitude.</br>You can sell anything?</br>
</p>
<p>
Sell me this fucking</br>pen right here.</br>
</p>
<p>
You can sell anything.</br>Sell that. Go ahead.</br>
</p>
<p>
Sell me the pen.</br>
</p>
<p>
Can I finish eating first?</br>I haven't eaten today.</br>
</p>
<p>
Brad, show them how</br>it's done. Boom.</br>
</p>
<p>
Sell me that pen. Watch. Go on.</br>
</p>
<p>
You want me to sell</br>this fucking pen?</br>
</p>
<p>
That's my boy right there.</br>Can fucking sell anything.</br>
</p>
<p>
Why don't you do me a favor.</br>
</p>
<p>
Write your name down</br>on that napkin for me.</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't have a pen.</br>
</p>
<p>
Exactly. Supply and</br>demand, my friend.</br>
</p>
<p>
Holy shit.</br>
</p>
<p>
See what I'm saying?</br>He's creating urgency.</br>
</p>
<p>
Get them to want to buy the stock.</br>
</p>
<p>
Convince them it's something</br>they need, you know what I mean?</br>
</p>
<p>
And that's the thing.</br>
</p>
<p>
All nuns are lesbians.</br>
</p>
<p>
What the fuck are you</br>talking about, Otter?</br>
</p>
<p>
Think about it.</br>They can't keep a dude</br>
</p>
<p>
so they're gonna start</br>fucking chicks.</br>
</p>
<p>
Four fucking times,</br>Kimmie! Four times.</br>

<p>
Now she runs.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>But look. I knew these</br>guys weren't like Harvard MBAs.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Robbie Feinberg, the pinhead,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>took five years to</br>finish high school.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Alden Kupferberg, the Sea Otter,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>didn't even graduate.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Chester Ming, the</br>depraved Chinaman,</i></br>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<i>Smartest of the bunch</br>was Nicky Koskoff.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>He actually went to law school.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I called him Rugrat because of</br>his piece of shit hairpiece.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Still, give them to me young,</br>hungry and stupid</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>and in no time,</br>I'll make them rich.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, my God.</br>
</p>
<p>
Jordan, that...</br>
</p>
<p>
You like it, baby?</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.</br>
</p>
<p>
They're not the biggest stones</br>in the world,</br>
</p>
<p>
but I promise they're</br>really high quality.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's beautiful.</br>
</p>
<p>
They're so beautiful.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, boy.</br>
</p>
<p>
What?</br>
</p>
<p>
I know that look.</br>What is it? Go ahead.</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't know, it's... You know...</br>
</p>
<p>
These stocks... These companies...</br>
</p>
<p>
They're like crappy companies.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Well, yeah.</br>- Okay.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, they're terrible.</br>
</p>
<p>
Don't worry about it. I told you,</br>
</p>
<p>
what I'm doing is completely legal.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, I know.</br>
</p>
<p>
But they're not gonna make</br>anyone money though, right?</br>
</p>
<p>
Well, sometimes they do,</br>sometimes they don't.</br>
</p>
<p>
You know how it goes.</br>
</p>
<p>
Wouldn't you feel better if you</br>sold that stuff to rich people</br>
</p>
<p>
who can, like,</br>afford to lose all that money?</br>
</p>
<p>
Of course.</br>
</p>
<p>
But rich people don't</br>buy penny stocks.</br>
</p>
<p>
They just don't.</br>
</p>
<p>
Why not?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Because they're too smart,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>that's why not.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I mean, what person with</br>a college education</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>would trust this</br>bunch of jerk-offs?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Hang up the phone.</br>Tell him you'll call him back.</br>
</p>
<p>
I got 5 fucking grand</br>on the phone right now!</br>
</p>
<p>
Hey!</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>But what if they didn't sound</br>like a bunch of jerk-offs?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>What if I could teach them</br>how to sell to people with money?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Real money.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>So I decided to</br>reinvent the company.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Gentlemen, welcome</br>
</p>
<p>
to Stratton Oakmont.</br>
</p>
<p>
You schnooks will now be targeting</br>
</p>
<p>
the wealthiest 1% of Americans.</br>
</p>
<p>
We're talking about whales here.</br>
</p>
<p>
Moby fucking Dicks.</br>
</p>
<p>
And with this script,</br>which is now your new harpoon,</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm gonna teach</br>each and every one of you</br>
</p>
<p>
to be Captain fucking Ahab.</br>
</p>
<p>
Get it? Huh?</br>
</p>
<p>
Captain who?</br>
</p>
<p>
Captain Ahab. From the fucking...</br>
</p>
<p>
The book, motherfucker.</br>From the book.</br>
</p>
<p>
Turn your fucking brain on.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Fuck you.</br>- Jesus fuck, Robbie.</br>
</p>
<p>
Listen to me. We're a</br>new company with a new name.</br>
</p>
<p>
A company that our</br>clients can believe in.</br>
</p>
<p>
A company that our</br>clients can trust.</br>
</p>
<p>
A firm whose roots are</br>so deeply embedded into Wall Street</br>
</p>
<p>
that our very founders sailed over</br>on the Mayflower</br>
</p>
<p>
and chiseled the name</br>Stratton Oakmont</br>
</p>
<p>
right into Plymouth fucking Rock!</br>
</p>
<p>
You got it?</br>
</p>
<p>
What we're gonna do is this.</br>
</p>
<p>
First we pitch 'em</br>Disney, AT&T, IBM,</br>
</p>
<p>
blue chip stocks exclusively.</br>
</p>
<p>
Companies these people know.</br>
</p>
<p>
Once we've suckered them in,</br>we unload the dog shit.</br>
</p>
<p>
The pink sheets, the penny stocks,</br>
</p>
<p>
where we make the money.</br>
</p>
<p>
- 50% commission, baby.</br>- Ooh.</br>
</p>
<p>
Now the key to making money</br>in a situation like this</br>
</p>
<p>
is to position yourself now</br>before the settlement.</br>
</p>
<p>
Because by the time you read about</br>it in <i>The Wall Street Journal,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
it's already too late.</br>
</p>
<p>
Then you wait.</br>
</p>
<p>
You wait.</br>
</p>
<p>
And whoever speaks first loses.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Sorry, uh...</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I appreciate the call.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I really have to give</br>this some thought</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>and talk to my wife about it.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Can I call you back?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
They don't know, right?</br>They gotta think about it,</br>
</p>
<p>
they gotta talk to their fucking</br>wives, or the fucking Tooth Fairy.</br>
</p>
<p>
Point is, it doesn't matter</br>what the fuck they say.</br>
</p>
<p>
The only real objection that they have</br>is that they don't trust you guys.</br>
</p>
<p>
And why should they trust you?</br>I mean, look at you.</br>
</p>
<p>
You're a bunch of fucking</br>sleazy salesmen, right?</br>
</p>
<p>
So, what do you say?</br>
</p>
<p>
You mean to tell me that if I put</br>you in at Union Carbide at 7</br>
</p>
<p>
and took you out at 32...</br>
</p>
<p>
Texas Instruments at 11</br>and took you out at 47...</br>
</p>
<p>
U.S. Steel at 16,</br>took you out at 41...</br>
</p>
<p>
You wouldn't be saying</br>to me right now, "Chester,</br>
</p>
<p>
"pick me up a few thousand</br>shares of Disney</br>
</p>
<p>
"on the spot, right now. Come on."</br>
</p>
<p>
Honestly, Kevin? Honestly?</br>Seriously?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I don't know you.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>You cold-called me.</br>You're a total stranger.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
I am in complete</br>agreement with you.</br>
</p>
<p>
You don't know me,</br>I don't know you.</br>
</p>
<p>
Let me introduce myself to you.</br>
</p>
<p>
My name is Alden Kupferberg.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Robbie Feinberg.</br>- Chester Ming.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm Senior Vice President</br>at Stratton Oakmont...</br>
</p>
<p>
and I plan on being one of the...</br>
</p>
<p>
top brokers in my firm next year.</br>
</p>
<p>
And I'm not gonna get there</br>by being wrong, Stanley.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I do wanna say that</br>you sound like a...</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>You sound like a</br>pretty sincere guy.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>It's not gonna make you rich</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>and it's not gonna make you poor.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
But what this trade</br>will do is serve as...</br>
</p>
<p>
a benchmark</br>for future business, Kevin.</br>
</p>
<p>
You feel comfortable</br>with me now, Scotty?</br>
</p>
<p>
And then you'll know for sure</br>
</p>
<p>
that you finally found</br>a broker on Wall Street</br>
</p>
<p>
that you can trust,</br>
</p>
<p>
and who can consistently</br>make you money.</br>
</p>
<p>
Sound fair enough?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>You know what... Yeah.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I gotta say, I'm pretty impressed.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>What are you thinking?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Kevin.</br>
</p>
<p>
You give me one shot here</br>
</p>
<p>
on a blue chip stock like Kodak,</br>
</p>
<p>
and believe me, Kevin,</br>
</p>
<p>
the only problem you're gonna have</br>
</p>
<p>
is that you didn't buy more.</br>
</p>
<p>
Sound fair enough?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Shit. My...</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Uh...</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>My wife might divorce me, but...</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Yeah, let's do it.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Excellent choice, Kevin.</br>
</p>
<p>
How much do you</br>want to go for this time?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Let's do 5... $5,000.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Can we try 8,000, Kevin?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>All right. Let's do 10.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>- Ten.</br>- You want to do that?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Excellent choice!</br>
</p>
<p>
Kevin, let me lock in</br>that trade right now</br>
</p>
<p>
and get back to you</br>in a few minutes</br>
</p>
<p>
with an exact confirmation, Kevin.</br>
</p>
<p>
And welcome to Stratton Oakmont.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Thanks, man. I'm gonna have a beer.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>This is fun.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Take it easy, Kev.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Hey, thanks, Jordan. Thanks a...</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Fuck that motherfucker!</br>
</p>
<p>
That's what I'm talking about!</br>
</p>
<p>
What a fucking idiot.</br>
</p>
<p>
The one thing I know about</br>in this world is airlines.</br>
</p>
<p>
And Cuchon Airlines</br>is the future of airlines.</br>
</p>
<p>
Get in now or...</br>
</p>
<p>
- I'm Nicky Koskoff...</br>- Chester Ming...</br>
</p>
<p>
and I'm a Senior Vice President</br>
</p>
<p>
with Stratton Oakmont.</br>
</p>
<p>
Judy, I am so, so, so</br>sorry for your loss.</br>
</p>
<p>
When did he pass?</br>
</p>
<p>
Just say I'm wrong, right.</br>
</p>
<p>
And the stock goes down</br>a couple points...</br>
</p>
<p>
and it makes you,</br>in the words of my grandfather,</br>
</p>
<p>
God rest his soul,</br>"A shit ton of money."</br>
</p>
<p>
It's like getting in</br>on fucking sunlight</br>
</p>
<p>
before there was fucking sunlight.</br>You understand?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Can we do 8,000 shares?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Okay, 25,000.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
That's a very intelligent decision.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm gonna transfer you</br>to my sales associate.</br>
</p>
<p>
Rhonda!</br>
</p>
<p>
- Rhonda!</br>- ...put you through to Andrea.</br>
</p>
<p>
Has anybody fucking seen Rhonda?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Everybody have a good week?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah!</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>The end of the month.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>$28.7 million in gross commissions,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>all from pink sheet stock, boys!</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>And to celebrate with our</br>weekly act of debauchery,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I have offered our</br>lovely sales assistant,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Danielle Harrison, here,</i></br>

You want this?</br>

<i>Let's scalp her! Scalp her!</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Let the scalping begin!</br>

<p>
Scalp! Scalp! Scalp!</br>

<p>
<i>FYI, boys, Danielle has promised</i></br>

<p>
<i>Donnie!</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Blow the roof off</br>this motherfucker!</i></br>
</p>
<p>
- Champagne?</br>- Whoo!</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Send in the stripees!</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Mine!</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Word about us</br>spread throughout Wall Street.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Even the places I</br>didn't want it to.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>It wasn't long before</br>Forbes magazine,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>the flagship of Wall Street,</br>called to do a profile on me.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Let me ask you, how do you see</br>the future for Stratton Oakmont?</br>
</p>
<p>
One word?</br>
</p>
<p>
Diversification.</br>
</p>
<p>
Sounds good. Thank you so much.</br>I have more than enough.</br>
</p>
<p>
- I appreciate your time.</br>- Fantastic.</br>
</p>
<p>
Can we get a quick picture?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>A total fucking hatchet job.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>This conniving little twat!</br>Look at this!</i></br>
</p>
<p>
"The Wolf of Wall Street"</br>they call me. Look.</br>
</p>
<p>
Your hair looks good.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Well, my hair looks good.</br>- Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
"Jordan Belfort,</br>
</p>
<p>
"sounding like a kind</br>of twisted Robin Hood</br>
</p>
<p>
"who takes from the rich</br>and gives to himself</br>
</p>
<p>
"and his merry little</br>band of brokers."</br>
</p>
<p>
- Read that. Read it.</br>- Listen.</br>
</p>
<p>
There is no such thing as</br>bad publicity, sweetheart.</br>
</p>
<p>
Read the article, babe.</br>
</p>
<p>
Jordan, you look great!</br>You're in a huge magazine.</br>
</p>
<p>
Big fucking deal I look great.</br>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Belfort!</br>Can you look at my resume, please?</br>
</p>
<p>
Excuse me, excuse me, sir!</br>
</p>
<p>
Calm the fuck down!</br>
</p>
<p>
What the hell's all this?</br>
</p>
<p>
It's the Forbes article.</br>They all want to work for you now.</br>
</p>
<p>
Hey! What did I say?</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm just trying to be nice.</br>
</p>
<p>
Hey, you want a job,</br>you talk to me!</br>
</p>
<p>
- Mr. Belfort!</br>- Give me one minute.</br>
</p>
<p>
Forbes made me a superstar.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Every day, dozens of money-crazed</br>kids beat a path to my door.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>If we hired 'em, they dropped</br>straight out of college overnight</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>and spent whatever</br>allowance they had</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>on a new suit from</br>our Stratton tailor.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Are you fucking serious right now?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I mean, we were literally putting</br>clothes on these kids' backs.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>And here comes this jerk-off</br>sniffing around.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>But, you know, every time</br>someone rises up in this world,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>there's always gonna be some</br>asshole trying to drag him down.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Within months, we doubled in size,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>moved to even bigger offices.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>It was a madhouse.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>A greed-fest,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>with equal parts cocaine,</br>testosterone, and body fluids.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Yes!</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>It got so bad, I had to declare</br>the office a fuck-free zone</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>between the hours of 9:00 and 7:00.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>But I'm telling you,</br>even that didn't help.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Actually, the madness started</br>on our very first day,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>when one of our</br>brokers, Ben Jenner,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>christened the elevator</br>by getting a blowjob</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>from a sales assistant.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Her name was Pam,</br>and to her credit,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>she did have this</br>amazing technique,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>with this wild twist</br>and jerk motion.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>About a month later,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Donnie and I decided</br>to double-team her</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>on a Saturday afternoon</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>while our wives were out shopping</br>for Christmas dresses.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Eventually, Ben married her,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>which was pretty amazing</br>considering she blew</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>every single guy in the office.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Then he got depressed and killed</br>himself three years later.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Anyway, I hired my dad, Max,</br>to maintain order as the Enforcer.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Stratton's very own Gestapo.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>We called him Mad Max</br>because of his hair-trigger temper,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>which could be set off by something</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>as innocuous as a</br>ringing telephone.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Who the fuck has the goddamn gall</br>
</p>
<p>
to call this house</br>on a Tuesday night?</br>
</p>
<p>
God damn it!</br>
</p>
<p>
You're gonna miss it!</br>
</p>
<p>
Ooh, please, tell me</br>something I don't know.</br>
</p>
<p>
I wait all week for</br>the fucking <i>Equalizer</i></br>
</p>
<p>
and they have to fucking... Hello.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>But as soon as</br>he picked up the phone...</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Gene. How are you, Gene?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>he'd affect this weird</br>British accent.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Right-o, Gene, that'd be great.</br>
</p>
<p>
Cheerio.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>It was absolutely bizarre.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
The fucking halfwit!</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>- He'd hang up...</i></br>- You missed it!</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>and then he's Mad</br>Max all over again.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Damn it!</br>
</p>
<p>
All right, tell me what happened.</br>What happened?</br>
</p>
<p>
Well, he discovered it</br>was the mother's sister.</br>
</p>
<p>
Who's he? Who? Tell me who...</br>
</p>
<p>
The main guy.</br>You know who the main...</br>
</p>
<p>
The main guy...</br>
</p>
<p>
it was his mother's sister.</br>She showed up dead.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Of course, Mad</br>Max didn't have to know</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>everything we were</br>doing at Stratton.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
And then there's a</br>big target and we...</br>
</p>
<p>
They get launched at the target.</br>They stick.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>There's a bull's-eye</br>and the bull's-eye's a dollar sign.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Whoever gets closer</br>to the dollar sign...</i></br>
</p>
<p>
gets the most points.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm gonna throw the shit out</br>of this little fucking thing.</br>
</p>
<p>
So if it gets hurt, what happens?</br>
</p>
<p>
'Cause we're gonna</br>get fucking nuts.</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't think he's gonna get hurt.</br>They're like...</br>
</p>
<p>
They got like superhuman strength.</br>
</p>
<p>
I think he's gonna be fine.</br>
</p>
<p>
You can't look him</br>right in the eyes.</br>
</p>
<p>
You can't look him in the eye?</br>
</p>
<p>
That's a fact. I saw it on PBS.</br>
</p>
<p>
They get confused</br>and their wires get crossed.</br>
</p>
<p>
You gotta look at their chin.</br>
</p>
<p>
Like it looks like</br>I'm looking at you</br>
</p>
<p>
but I'm looking at your chin.</br>
</p>
<p>
I feel like you're addressing me</br>right now, but you're not, are you?</br>
</p>
<p>
They're like <i>the Mona Lisa.</i></br>They find eye contact,</br>
</p>
<p>
like, wherever you are</br>standing in the room.</br>
</p>
<p>
And they lock in.</br>
</p>
<p>
No, but there is a limit</br>to what we can do with them?</br>
</p>
<p>
We're allowed to throw shit at 'em.</br>
</p>
<p>
We're allowed to</br>throw food? Bananas.</br>
</p>
<p>
Any food. Correct.</br>
</p>
<p>
But, for example,</br>what I wouldn't do is</br>
</p>
<p>
maybe like tell him</br>to pull his cock out</br>
</p>
<p>
and like get some of the girls to,</br>you know,</br>
</p>
<p>
fondle him and shit like that.</br>
</p>
<p>
That would be...</br>That's unacceptable?</br>
</p>
<p>
Let's keep that in our back pocket.</br>
</p>
<p>
This guy is more about</br>throwing at the dartboard.</br>
</p>
<p>
Correct. Yes, yes, yes.</br>
</p>
<p>
The thing is, this</br>is their gift, okay.</br>
</p>
<p>
They're built to be thrown</br>like a lawn dart.</br>
</p>
<p>
They're top heavy like a lawn dart.</br>
</p>
<p>
So they're built for accuracy.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, my God. Can we</br>bowl with this guy?</br>
</p>
<p>
That's his fucking brother, Rob.</br>
</p>
<p>
His brother's the bowling ball.</br>
</p>
<p>
The brother,</br>you put a skateboard on him,</br>
</p>
<p>
you strap him to a skateboard,</br>
</p>
<p>
you toss him down an</br>alley at some pins.</br>
</p>
<p>
- No shit. That's interesting.</br>- Swear to fucking God.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Can we get that guy?</br>- Yeah, we'll get that guy, too.</br>
</p>
<p>
But it says here this guy</br>will show his cock. Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Instead of growing up. Yeah.</br>- He will?</br>
</p>
<p>
They are very ornery by the way,</br>
</p>
<p>
so you gotta be very careful</br>with these little guys.</br>
</p>
<p>
Safety first.</br>
</p>
<p>
Safety is first, all right?</br>
</p>
<p>
I want somebody with</br>a fucking tranquilizer gun</br>
</p>
<p>
ready to knock this fucker out.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Do we want to get like a...</br>- Mace. Taser guns.</br>
</p>
<p>
A pellet gun maybe?</br>
</p>
<p>
No, a pellet gun is gonna hurt him.</br>
</p>
<p>
I just want him out.</br>Knocked out cold.</br>
</p>
<p>
But I say we stick with</br>the loophole. Right? Okay?</br>
</p>
<p>
If we don't consider him a human,</br>
</p>
<p>
we just consider it an act,</br>I think we're in the clear.</br>
</p>
<p>
Like The Flying Wallendas.</br>
</p>
<p>
You know, a lot of those guys died</br>but they never sued anybody.</br>
</p>
<p>
The important thing</br>you guys gotta keep in mind</br>
</p>
<p>
is that these things gossip.</br>
</p>
<p>
They get together and they gossip.</br>
</p>
<p>
- That's a good point.</br>- And the last thing</br>
</p>
<p>
that we need is them</br>getting together and saying,</br>
</p>
<p>
"Oh, they made fun of us."</br>
</p>
<p>
Like, it's gonna make</br>Stratton look bad.</br>
</p>
<p>
That's why I love you.</br>You think of shit like that.</br>
</p>
<p>
When they come in, we treat</br>it just like one of us. Okay?</br>
</p>
<p>
One of us.</br>Gooble gobble, one of us.</br>
</p>
<p>
We accept them, one of us!</br>
</p>
<p>
Gooble gobble, one of us.</br>
</p>
<p>
We accept them, one of us.</br>
</p>
<p>
Gooble gobble, one of us!</br>
</p>
<p>
Jordan! Your dad's coming.</br>
</p>
<p>
Something about the</br>American Express bill.</br>
</p>
<p>
Can you get him out of here?</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah. Lick my twat.</br>
</p>
<p>
No, I'm serious!</br>
</p>
<p>
Fuck. Guys, act like we're working.</br>
</p>
<p>
You got any fucking stock forms?</br>
</p>
<p>
He's coming, he's coming.</br>
</p>
<p>
Make some shit up.</br>
</p>
<p>
I think if we short Pfizer...</br>
</p>
<p>
$430,000 in one month, Jordy, huh?</br>
</p>
<p>
Four hundred and fucking 30,000</br>fucking dollars in one fucking month!</br>
</p>
<p>
Good morning.</br>They're business expenses. Relax.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Business expenses?</br>- Yes.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Jordy, look what you got here.</br>- What?</br>
</p>
<p>
Look at this. $26,000</br>for one fucking dinner!</br>
</p>
<p>
Okay. No, no.</br>This could be explained.</br>
</p>
<p>
Dad, we had clients.</br>The Pfizer clients.</br>
</p>
<p>
Right. The porterhouse</br>from Argentina.</br>
</p>
<p>
Expensive champagne and...</br>We had to buy champagne.</br>
</p>
<p>
And you ordered all</br>the fucking sides.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Tell him about the sides.</br>- I ordered sides, so...</br>
</p>
<p>
Sides? $26,000 worth of sides?</br>
</p>
<p>
What are these sides?</br>They cure cancer?</br>
</p>
<p>
The sides did cure cancer.</br>That's the problem.</br>
</p>
<p>
That's why they were expensive.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Shut the fuck up.</br>- I'm serious.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Stop.</br>- And EJ Entertainment?</br>
</p>
<p>
What the fuck is EJ Entertainment?</br>
</p>
<p>
Well, that's, uh...</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, Jordy,</br>what's EJ Entertainment?</br>
</p>
<p>
How do I describe this?</br>
</p>
<p>
Jord, what is that?</br>
</p>
<p>
- It's a fucking prostitution ring, Jordy!</br>- I know.</br>
</p>
<p>
- That's what it is!</br>- That is what it is.</br>
</p>
<p>
Isn't that the perfect</br>description for it?</br>
</p>
<p>
That is what it is. But none</br>of these were charged to me.</br>
</p>
<p>
This is all of them.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Oh, that was all us?</br>- It wasn't me though.</br>
</p>
<p>
Fucking explain this shit to him!</br>
</p>
<p>
These are all of your</br>fucking charges right here!</br>
</p>
<p>
The IRS, they allow</br>for T&A. It's fine.</br>
</p>
<p>
T&E!</br>
</p>
<p>
T&E!</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah. I said T&E.</br>
</p>
<p>
- No, no. You said T&A.</br>- No, I didn't.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, you did.</br>
</p>
<p>
- When did I say that?</br>- You said T&A. It's T&E.</br>
</p>
<p>
I know you're upset</br>about the dinner,</br>
</p>
<p>
and that makes sense because we did</br>spend too much money. But I said T&E.</br>
</p>
<p>
Don't tell me what you said.</br>I heard what you said.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Dad. He said T&A.</br>- He did?</br>
</p>
<p>
Absolutely, no question.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm trying to...</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm getting this close!</br>
</p>
<p>
- Dad, relax.</br>- I'm getting this close.</br>
</p>
<p>
That's what I'm saying.</br>I want you to open up more, Max.</br>
</p>
<p>
He's gonna fucking kill you.</br>
</p>
<p>
Why do you hold it in?</br>Why do you...</br>
</p>
<p>
Max, why do you hold it in?</br>
</p>
<p>
That's it. Get the</br>fuck out of here!</br>
</p>
<p>
- No, no, no!</br>- Asshole, get out of here.</br>
</p>
<p>
What kind of hooker</br>takes credit cards?</br>
</p>
<p>
A rich one.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>At Stratton,</br>there were three kinds of hookers.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>The Blue Chips, top of the line,</br>model material.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>They cost between $300 and $500</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>and you had to wear a condom</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>unless you gave them a hefty tip,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>which, of course, I always did.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Then came the NASDAQs,</br>who were pretty, not great.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>They cost between</br>200 and 300 bucks.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Finally, there were the</br>Pink Sheets. Skanks.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>They cost about 100 or less.</br>If you didn't wear a condom,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>you'd have to get a penicillin shot</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>the next day</br>and pray your dick didn't fall off.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Not that we didn't fuck them, too.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Believe me, we did.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Ow! It's that slipped</br>disc thing again.</br>
</p>
<p>
I know what it is.</br>You know, too much...</br>
</p>
<p>
with EJ Entertainment.</br>
</p>
<p>
Pops.</br>
</p>
<p>
How are things at home?</br>
</p>
<p>
Well, not the best.</br>
</p>
<p>
She just doesn't...</br>You know what I'm saying?</br>
</p>
<p>
It's like the smell...</br>
</p>
<p>
There's a smell,</br>there's an attraction thing.</br>
</p>
<p>
After a while it kind of fades away</br>a little bit.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, well. It's</br>supposed to fade away.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Supposed to?</br>- That's marriage. You know...</br>
</p>
<p>
Your mother and I, we've been</br>married a long, long time.</br>
</p>
<p>
What do you think? We're, we're...</br>
</p>
<p>
We're jumping into bed</br>every two minutes?</br>
</p>
<p>
- It doesn't work that way.</br>- I love her to death.</br>
</p>
<p>
I want to stay married, Dad, but...</br>
</p>
<p>
It's crazy out there.</br>
</p>
<p>
Some of these girls...</br>You should see them.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, my God!</br>
</p>
<p>
They're fucking...</br>
</p>
<p>
The things they're doing now, Pops.</br>
</p>
<p>
I mean... I mean, it's</br>on a whole other level.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Really?</br>- And they're all shaved, too.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Get out of here!</br>- All shaven.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Are you kidding me?</br>- Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Bald as a china doll.</br>- No bush?</br>
</p>
<p>
- No bush.</br>- Oh, my God!</br>
</p>
<p>
All of a sudden, one week, nobody</br>had anything down there anymore.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's a new world.</br>
</p>
<p>
They're bald from</br>the eyebrows down.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Wow.</br>- Nothing. Not a stitch. It's like lasers.</br>
</p>
<p>
Wow. A new world.</br>
</p>
<p>
I was born too... Too early.</br>
</p>
<p>
I've never been a fan of the bush,</br>to be honest.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Really?</br>- Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't mind it.</br>
</p>
<p>
Dad.</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't want you stressing out</br>about any of this.</br>
</p>
<p>
How can I not get stressed out?</br>
</p>
<p>
Look at the knuckleheads</br>you got working for you.</br>
</p>
<p>
I know they're knuckleheads</br>
</p>
<p>
but I need them to want to</br>live like me, you get it?</br>
</p>
<p>
To live like me.</br>
</p>
<p>
Jordy.</br>
</p>
<p>
One of these days, the chickens are</br>gonna come home to roost.</br>
</p>
<p>
You're looking at</br>me like I'm crazy.</br>
</p>
<p>
Crazy? This is obscene.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>It was obscene.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>In the normal world.</i></br>

<p>
<i>But who the fuck</br>wanted to live there?</i></br>

Why should they be taking all our</br>fucking money all the fucking time?</br>

This way we become</br>the underwriters.</br>

<i>It was our next big move.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Finding companies to</br>take public. IPOs.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>It was the only way</br>these Wall Street pricks</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>would ever stop thinking of us</br>as some shitkicker bucket shop.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
We got Arncliffe International.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>See, we were a little different.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>We liked to get as fucked up as</br>possible during our business powwows</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>in order to stimulate</br>our free-flowing ideas,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>which is why we were popping</br>these ludes like they were M&M's.</i></br>

<i>Don't know what</br>a lude is? I'll tell you.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Oh. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.</i></br>

<p>

</p>
<p>
The Quaalude,</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>or lude, as it is</br>commonly referred to,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>was first synthesized in 1951</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>by an Indian doctor,</br>that's dots, not feathers,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>as a sedative,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>and was prescribed to stressed-out</br>housewives with sleep disorders.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>But pretty soon someone figured out</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>that if you resisted the urge</br>to sleep for just 15 minutes,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>you got a pretty</br>kick-ass high from it.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Didn't take long for people to</br>start abusing ludes, of course.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>And in 1982, the U-S.</br>government Schedule 1'd them.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Along with the rest of the world.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Which meant there was only a finite</br>amount of these things left.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>No shit,</br>you can't even buy 'em anymore.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>You people are all</br>shit out of luck.</i></br>

Hi, Blair. Nice to meet you.</br>

</p>
<p>
You like to Jet Ski?</br>
</p>
<p>
I've never done it before.</br>
</p>
<p>
You've never</br>Jet Ski'd in your life?</br>
</p>
<p>
No, I've never Jet Ski'd.</br>
</p>
<p>
You've never been on a Jet Ski?</br>
</p>
<p>
How many times are</br>you gonna ask her?</br>
</p>
<p>
She's never been on a Jet Ski.</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't know.</br>Might ask her a couple more times.</br>
</p>
<p>
Okay. Sure.</br>
</p>
<p>
Hi. I'm Hildy. Nice to meet you.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Hi.</br>- Jordan, Teresa needs your help.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, I'll be out in</br>a couple of minutes.</br>
</p>
<p>
Just tell her I'll be out</br>in a couple of minutes.</br>
</p>
<p>
Why don't you tell your wife that?</br>
</p>
<p>
I might do that, but I'm having</br>
</p>
<p>
- a conversation right now.</br>- What am I, your secretary?</br>
</p>
<p>
You know what,</br>I think we should get going.</br>
</p>
<p>
Wait, wait. Where you guys going?</br>
</p>
<p>
We gotta go.</br>We got two other parties to go to.</br>
</p>
<p>
- We can stay for a drink.</br>- Yeah, stay for a drink.</br>
</p>
<p>
No. We got two other parties</br>we're supposed to get to.</br>
</p>
<p>
But we can stay for a drink...</br>
</p>
<p>
She's</br>
</p>
<p>
perfect.</br>
</p>
<p>
- You like champagne?</br>- I do.</br>
</p>
<p>
She's perfect.</br>
</p>
<p>
Donnie, what the</br>fuck are you doing?</br>
</p>
<p>
You piece of...</br>
</p>
<p>
You're gonna have to excuse my friend.</br>He gets...</br>
</p>
<p>
Get the fuck out!</br>
</p>
<p>
Jordan, you gotta fuck her, bro.</br>She's so hot!</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, Donnie!</br>
</p>
<p>
Let him fucking finish, Hildy.</br>
</p>
<p>
That's fucking rude.</br>
</p>
<p>
Have some fucking manners.</br>
</p>
<p>
So, Bay Ridge,</br>that's near Staten Island, right?</br>
</p>
<p>
Brooklyn, across the</br>Verrazano Bridge.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Saturday Night Fever</i> territory.</br>
</p>
<p>
That's right. Guinea Gulch.</br>
</p>
<p>
We call the Verrazano Bridge</br>the Guinea Gangplank.</br>
</p>
<p>
Right.</br>
</p>
<p>
So I presume you're Italian?</br>
</p>
<p>
On my dad's side.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm also Dutch, German, English.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm a mutt.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah. You're a mutt.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, I still have family</br>over there though, in London.</br>
</p>
<p>
My Aunt Emma. She's the best.</br>
</p>
<p>
Very British, you know.</br>She's a classy lady.</br>
</p>
<p>
That explains it then.</br>
</p>
<p>
Explains what?</br>
</p>
<p>
It explains you.</br>I mean, you're a duchess, right?</br>
</p>
<p>
The Duchess of Bay Ridge.</br>
</p>
<p>
Excuse me.</br>
</p>
<p>
Could I get a straw, please?</br>
</p>
<p>
Thank you.</br>
</p>
<p>
So I was, um, a little surprised</br>
</p>
<p>
you asked Cristy for my number.</br>
</p>
<p>
Why is that?</br>
</p>
<p>
Aren't you married?</br>
</p>
<p>
Well... Yeah, but what?</br>
</p>
<p>
Married people can't have friends?</br>
</p>
<p>
We're gonna be friends?</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah. You don't want</br>to be my friend?</br>
</p>
<p>
We're not gonna be friends.</br>
</p>
<p>
And at night I work on my designs.</br>
</p>
<p>
I have an entire line of lingerie.</br>
</p>
<p>
You know, camisoles,</br>bustiers, panties.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>She designs women's panties, too?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Oh, my God!</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Come on, Jordan, think of a way</br>to get up to her apartment.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
You wanna come up for</br>some tea or something?</br>
</p>
<p>
Tea? Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Like hot tea?</br>- Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, yeah. That sounds nice. Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Tea. Fuck, yeah,</br>I wanted to come up for tea.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Like Darjeeling or rose hip,</br>something nice like that?</br>
</p>
<p>
Sure.</br>
</p>
<p>
This is Rocky.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, who's this? Say hi, Rocky.</br>
</p>
<p>
Hi, sweetheart.</br>
</p>
<p>
Okay.</br>
</p>
<p>
Why don't you light a fire or</br>something and I'll be right out.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Yeah. Fire, here?</br>- Sure.</br>
</p>
<p>
I like your painting here.</br>It's, uh...</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>God, help me.</br>How do I fuck this girl?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
You all right?</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, yeah.</br>Just trying to light the fire here.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>That's it. That's it,</br>you're leaving.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Don't get involved.</br>Go home to your wife.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>As you can probably guess,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I fucked her goddamn brains out...</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Jesus Lord!</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>For 11 seconds.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Did you just come?</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, yeah, I just came.</br>
</p>
<p>
Did you? Did you come?</br>
</p>
<p>
- No.</br>- No?</br>
</p>
<p>
Okay.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm still hard so</br>just give me a sec.</br>
</p>
<p>
Sure.</br>
</p>
<p>
Come on, baby, come on.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, God!</br>
</p>
<p>
Fuck off, Rocky! Bad dog.</br>
</p>
<p>
You have a biscuit</br>or something like that?</br>
</p>
<p>
It's okay.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Just keep going.</br>- Rocky, go play.</br>
</p>
<p>
Go play, Rocky. Go, go, go, go.</br>
</p>
<p>
You're crazy.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I couldn't get enough.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I mean, her pussy was</br>like heroin to me.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>And it wasn't just</br>about the sex, either.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Naomi and I got along.</br>I mean, we...</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>We had similar interests and shit.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Ooh. Choo-choo train.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
I think I can. I think I can.</br>I think I can. I think I can.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, yeah.</br>Let's toke it all on there, huh?</br>
</p>
<p>
Whoo-hoo-hoo!</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, shit!</br>
</p>
<p>
You!</br>
</p>
<p>
Get out of the fucking car!</br>
</p>
<p>
Jesus Christ.</br>
</p>
<p>
Son of a bitch! Oh, fuck!</br>
</p>
<p>
Relax, sweetheart. Relax.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Son of a fucking bitch!</br>- Okay, okay... Geez!</br>
</p>
<p>
Okay, babe, stop!</br>
</p>
<p>
- Please.</br>- Bitch!</br>
</p>
<p>
- What are you doing...</br>- That whore from the party?</br>
</p>
<p>
Jesus Christ!</br>
</p>
<p>
What the fuck is wrong with you?</br>
</p>
<p>
I thought you were at</br>the fucking beach!</br>
</p>
<p>
I didn't know you were here!</br>
</p>
<p>
That's where you've fucking been?</br>
</p>
<p>
With that fucking</br>whore from the party?</br>
</p>
<p>
I thought you were</br>at the beach house.</br>
</p>
<p>
How could you do this to me?</br>
</p>
<p>
- Sweetie, come on...</br>- Who the fuck are you, Jordan?</br>
</p>
<p>
You're like a completely</br>different fucking person!</br>
</p>
<p>
I made a mistake. I don't know</br>what to tell you, babe. I...</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm sorry.</br>
</p>
<p>
- I'm sorry.</br>- Is that who... Is that what you want?</br>
</p>
<p>
Do you love her?</br>
</p>
<p>
Answer me.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I felt horrible.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Three days later,</br>I filed for a divorce</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>and moved Naomi into the apartment.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Say what you will,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>but the Duchess did have style.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>She brought in a decorator,</br>feng shui'd the whole place.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>She even hired a gay butler.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>This guy was smart,</i></br><i>sophisticated, professional</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Really, really great.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Is that jasmine?</br>
</p>
<p>
Yes, sir. I tried to stump you</br>this evening. Very good.</br>
</p>
<p>
Very good. Great nose.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Except for that one time.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, my God!</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, hey.</br>
</p>
<p>
Is it Wednesday already?</br>
</p>
<p>
- Uh...</br>- Oh, don't stop.</br>
</p>
<p>
What the fuck!</br>
</p>
<p>
That is fucked up!</br>
</p>
<p>
He must have thought we were still</br>
</p>
<p>
at the Hamptons this weekend,</br>you know.</br>
</p>
<p>
Where were they doing it,</br>sweetheart? In the bedroom?</br>
</p>
<p>
They were everywhere. There were</br>two guys over there on the table.</br>
</p>
<p>
There were more over here.</br>
</p>
<p>
- There were four right here.</br>- Ugh!</br>
</p>
<p>
Are you fucking serious?</br>Right there?</br>
</p>
<p>
- Why didn't you tell me?</br>- Oh, baby, it gets worse.</br>
</p>
<p>
After they left,</br>I checked the apartment.</br>
</p>
<p>
Right. What?</br>
</p>
<p>
What is it, babe? What?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Where's my money?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
I don't know where your money...</br>
</p>
<p>
Where is my fucking money?</br>Where is it?</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't know where your money is,</br>Mr. Belfort.</br>
</p>
<p>
- I didn't do anything.</br>- If you don't get...</br>
</p>
<p>
He's lying through</br>his fucking teeth.</br>
</p>
<p>
Let's start from the beginning.</br>
</p>
<p>
Let's start from the</br>beginning, all right?</br>
</p>
<p>
You invited some</br>friends over, right?</br>
</p>
<p>
One thing led to another.</br>Things got out of hand.</br>
</p>
<p>
We understand that, we do.</br>
</p>
<p>
We do blow all the time. We're</br>fucking degenerates ourselves.</br>
</p>
<p>
Look at us, right?</br>
</p>
<p>
But money was stolen</br>from my apartment.</br>
</p>
<p>
Right from my sock drawer.</br>All right?</br>
</p>
<p>
Like I said,</br>I don't know where your money is.</br>
</p>
<p>
Just start from the beginning.</br>Who came over?</br>
</p>
<p>
It was just a normal day.</br>
</p>
<p>
I knew you were coming home</br>the next day.</br>
</p>
<p>
So everything would be fine.</br>It'd be cleaned up.</br>
</p>
<p>
I got a little high at breakfast.</br>
</p>
<p>
So I got a little happy.</br>I had some eggs,</br>
</p>
<p>
I had a little bit of ice cream.</br>
</p>
<p>
And then I said, "Who do I</br>know that likes ice cream?"</br>
</p>
<p>
It's my friend, Rudy.</br>So I called Rudy.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Who's Rudy?</br>- Yeah, who's Rudy?</br>
</p>
<p>
- You know who Rudy is. Come on.</br>- Me? I don't...</br>
</p>
<p>
- You know...</br>- Who the fuck is Rudy?</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't know anyone named Rudy.</br>
</p>
<p>
Last month. The Lollipop Club.</br>
</p>
<p>
You know who Rudy was. Dancing...</br>
</p>
<p>
You know who Rudy is?</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't fucking know any...</br>
</p>
<p>
What do you mean?</br>
</p>
<p>
So he went to The Lollipop Club?</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, he was</br>at The Lollipop Club for sure.</br>
</p>
<p>
On the stage, grinding</br>with everybody.</br>
</p>
<p>
I got fucked up. I like to dance.</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't know.</br>Maybe I met him, maybe I didn't.</br>
</p>
<p>
I meet a lot of fucking people.</br>
</p>
<p>
- What are you saying?</br>- $50,000 was stolen</br>
</p>
<p>
from my fucking sock drawer!</br>
</p>
<p>
All my girlfriend's</br>jewelry is gone.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Where the fuck is it?</br>- ...Rudy. What the fuck?</br>
</p>
<p>
Did your fucking little faggot</br>friend Rudy take my shit?</br>
</p>
<p>
Did he? Answer me!</br>
</p>
<p>
Okay. Now I get it.</br>Now I get why I'm...</br>
</p>
<p>
- This is a gay thing.</br>- Oh!</br>
</p>
<p>
See, all of you...</br>
</p>
<p>
You think this is</br>'cause you're a fag?</br>
</p>
<p>
My cousin's a fucking faggot.</br>
</p>
<p>
And I go on vacation with him</br>and his boyfriend. I love fags.</br>
</p>
<p>
You were in charge, right?</br>
</p>
<p>
I will not be stolen from.</br>You get that?</br>
</p>
<p>
I fucking like gay people.</br>I don't like you.</br>
</p>
<p>
He should've hired</br>a fucking Mexican</br>
</p>
<p>
like I have in my fucking house.</br>
</p>
<p>
Shit! What the fuck...</br>
</p>
<p>
Talk, you fuck, talk!</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm gonna drop you, you faggot!</br>
</p>
<p>
Where is it?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Chester and Toby,</br>they went all yakuza on Nicholas.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>You know, they got crazy.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
I don't know!</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I had to call the cops just to</br>keep them from killing the poor guy.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I gave them each 1,000 bucks</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>and told them what</br>Nicholas had done.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Then they kicked his ass.</i></br>

<p>
Thanks again, Officer.</br>

<p>

<i>I'd drive the price up</br>then he'd sell</i></br>

<i>You guessed it, me.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>All cash. None of</br>it's on the books.</i></br>

Do not worry about it.</br>I have the SEC under control.</br>
</p>
<p>
What the fuck</br>are these imbeciles doing?</br>
</p>
<p>
Hey! Hey!</br>
</p>
<p>
What are you doing? Hey!</br>
</p>
<p>
We got the SEC in here.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>The Securities</br>and Exchange Commission</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>sent two lawyers down</br>to review our files.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>So I set them up in</br>our conference room</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>and I had it bugged</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>and the air conditioning</br>turned up so high</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>that it felt like</br>Antarctica in there.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Is it always this cold in here?</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't know.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Then, while they were looking</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>for a smoking gun in that room...</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Arncliffe International is on fire.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I was gonna fire off</br>a bazooka in here,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>offering up our latest IPO.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
An IPO is an initial</br>public offering.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's the first time a stock is offered</br>for sale to the general population.</br>
</p>
<p>
Now, as the firm taking</br>the company public,</br>
</p>
<p>
we set the initial sales price</br>
</p>
<p>
then sold those shares</br>right back to our friends. The...</br>
</p>
<p>
Look.</br>
</p>
<p>
I know you're not following</br>what I'm saying anyway, right?</br>
</p>
<p>
That's okay. That doesn't matter.</br>
</p>
<p>
The real question is this.</br>
</p>
<p>
"Was all this legal?"</br>
</p>
<p>
Absolutely fucking not.</br>
</p>
<p>
But we were making more money</br>than we knew what to do with.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>And what do you do</br>when you're making</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>more money than you</br>know what to do with?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, my God!</br>
</p>
<p>
Will you marry me?</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, my God.</br>
</p>
<p>
Is that a yes?</br>
</p>
<p>
Are you sure?</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah, I'm sure.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Are you sure?</br>- Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I held my bachelor party</br>at the Mirage in Las Vegas.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>The flight there alone</br>was a bacchanal.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>One last blowout for the gods</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>before I settled down for good.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>A hundred Strattonites,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>50 hookers, plus 50 more</br>waiting once we landed.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Oh, and the drugs.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I mean, I tell you, our plane was</br>like a pharmacy with wings.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>All told, the weekend</br>cost me 2 million bucks,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>including the cost of refurbishing</br>the entire 28th floor.</i></br>

kiss the bride.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Ah! But the wedding</i></br>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<i>With Naomi, my Duchess,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>me, her handsome Duke,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>and The Bahamas Ocean Club,</br>our castle.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Of course, after the bachelor</br>party, me, the Duke,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>needed a few penicillin shots</br>so he could</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>safely consummate the marriage.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Hey! Barry Kleinman,</br>filming the wedding.</br>
</p>
<p>
A few words for your son?</br>
</p>
<p>
Jordan. Remember what I told you.</br>
</p>
<p>
It involves your penis</br>and her vagina.</br>
</p>
<p>
And you know,</br>you know what you can do, Jordy.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, my God!</br>
</p>
<p>
Aunt Emma?</br>
</p>
<p>
I can't believe you came!</br>
</p>
<p>
Jordan! Jordan! Look who came!</br>
</p>
<p>
It's Aunt Emma.</br>
</p>
<p>
Aunt Emma.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Oh, Jordan, dear, how lovely.</br>- Hey, how you doing?</br>
</p>
<p>
It's a pleasure to finally meet you</br>in person.</br>
</p>
<p>
Into the donuts, I see.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, I... I...</br>
</p>
<p>
Well...</br>
</p>
<p>
I lived through the '60s, my dear.</br>
</p>
<p>
Enjoy the day.</br>
</p>
<p>
She surprised me.</br>I didn't even know.</br>
</p>
<p>
Just one more step. Are you ready?</br>
</p>
<p>
- Where are we going?</br>- Keep your eyes closed.</br>
</p>
<p>
One, two, three!</br>
</p>
<p>
What is this?</br>
</p>
<p>
It's your wedding present.</br>
</p>
<p>
What?</br>
</p>
<p>
It's your wedding present,</br>sweetheart.</br>
</p>
<p>
What?</br>
</p>
<p>
- Are you serious?</br>- I'm serious.</br>
</p>
<p>
A fucking yacht?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>For millionaires</br>whose ships have come in,</i></br>
</p>
<p>

"Who?" What are you, a fucking owl?</br>

You're a fucking</br>dirty little birdy!</br>

<p>
Owie!</br>

<p>
That's right.</br>
</p>
<p>
That's right! I forgot.</br>
</p>
<p>
I forgot, baby.</br>
</p>
<p>
Donnie and I were investing</br>
</p>
<p>
in a condominium complex in Venice.</br>
</p>
<p>
That's why all this confusion.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, you're investing in Italy?</br>
</p>
<p>
Not Italy. California.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Oh, California?</br>- Yeah.</br>

You're a lying piece of shit!</br>

Duchess, baby, come on.</br>
</p>
<p>
Don't you fucking "Duchess" me.</br>

<p>
Don't you "Duchess" me!</br>

- You're a father now, Jordan.</br>- Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
- You're a father now.</br>- I know...</br>

And you're still</br>acting like an infant!</br>
</p>
<p>
God damn it!</br>
</p>
<p>
Baby, you know,</br>you got real anger issues.</br>
</p>
<p>
Who is the one who flew in here</br>
</p>
<p>
at 3:00 in the morning</br>on their stupid helicopter</br>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Oh, Skylar! Oh, fucking bullshit!</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Does it even matter to you</i></br>

- and now you fucking wrecked it!</br>- Oh, my God... Bermuda grass.</br>
</p>
<p>
No, you didn't research</br>the whole thing</br>

</p>
<p>
Oh, my God,</br>
</p>
<p>
you had to deal</br>with the golf course people, too!</br>
</p>
<p>
What a Greek tragedy, honey!</br>Oh, my God!</br>
</p>
<p>
You probably had to pay them</br>in cash with your hands!</br>
</p>
<p>
What a fucking burden.</br>
</p>
<p>
And actually do some work</br>besides swiping</br>
</p>
<p>
my fucking credit</br>card all day, huh?</br>
</p>
<p>
Because I can't keep track</br>of your professions, honey.</br>
</p>
<p>
'Cause last month</br>you were a wine connoisseur.</br>
</p>
<p>
Now you're an aspiring</br>landscape architect!</br>
</p>
<p>
- Let me get that right... No!</br>- Fuck you!</br>
</p>
<p>
Don't fucking dare throw that</br>
</p>

fucking water at me.</br>Don't you fucking dare.</br>
</p>
<p>
All right, honey?</br>
</p>
<p>
Now will you just...</br>
</p>
<p>
We could talk this out, all right?</br>
</p>
<p>
We just use our words. You know?</br>
</p>
<p>
Communicate.</br>
</p>
<p>
Okay?</br>
</p>
<p>
Come on, sweetheart.</br>
</p>
<p>
Talk to me. Talk to me.</br>
</p>
<p>
Stop flexing your muscles, Jordan.</br>
</p>
<p>
You look like a fucking imbecile.</br>
</p>
<p>
Babe, come on.</br>
</p>
<p>
You should feel happy</br>you got a husband</br>
</p>
<p>
who's in such great</br>shape like this, huh?</br>
</p>
<p>
Come here.</br>
</p>
<p>
Come on, give me a kiss.</br>
</p>
<p>
You look so beautiful right now.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Come on.</br>- Kiss you?</br>
</p>
<p>
- You look so beautiful...</br>- Kiss you?</br>

Yeah, give me one...</br>

Fuck you!</br>

<i>Ah, yes, my morning ritual.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>First I'd get up and</br>fight with Naomi</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>about whatever it is I did</br>the night before.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Next was a steam so</br>I could sweat out</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>the drugs still in my system.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Then I'd assess the damage.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Drown out my eyeballs.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Take my "back pills"</br>to get the day started,</i></br>

</p>
<p>
Good morning, Daddy.</br>
</p>
<p>
Where's my kiss?</br>
</p>
<p>
Whee!</br>
</p>
<p>
Hey, sweetheart.</br>
</p>
<p>
Does Daddy get a kiss</br>from both of his little girls, huh?</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, no.</br>
</p>
<p>
No, Daddy doesn't even</br>get to touch Mommy</br>
</p>
<p>
for a very, very,</br>
</p>
<p>
very long time.</br>
</p>
<p>
Daddy's really sorry about what</br>he said in the other room.</br>
</p>
<p>
He didn't mean any of it.</br>
</p>
<p>
Daddy shouldn't waste his time.</br>
</p>
<p>
And from now on,</br>
</p>
<p>
it's gonna be nothing but short,</br>
</p>
<p>
short skirts around the house.</br>
</p>
<p>
And you know something else, Daddy?</br>
</p>
<p>
Mommy is just so sick and</br>tired of wearing panties.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Yeah?</br>- Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
In fact,</br>
</p>
<p>
she's decided to throw them</br>
</p>
<p>
all away.</br>
</p>
<p>
So take a good look, Daddy.</br>
</p>
<p>
You're gonna be seeing an awful</br>lot of this around the house.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, baby...</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, Mommy.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Yeah...</br>- But no touching.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, gosh.</br>
</p>
<p>
Ow.</br>
</p>
<p>
What's wrong, Daddy?</br>
</p>
<p>
Mmm, baby.</br>
</p>
<p>
God!</br>
</p>
<p>
Look at this shit.</br>
</p>
<p>
Okay. Mommy likes to</br>play games with Daddy.</br>
</p>
<p>
Mommy, have you ever noticed</br>
</p>
<p>
anything odd about Mr...</br>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Fuzzy Bear over there?</br>
</p>
<p>
His eyes seem</br>to be a little bit odd, don't they?</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, there's something a little</br>bit different about his eyes.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yes!</br>I think it's true. Say "Hi," Mommy.</br>
</p>
<p>
Say "Hi" to Rocco and Rocco.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>- Say "Hi." Hi, fellas.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
See that, huh?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Of all the fucking days,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>she chooses today to</br>give me blue balls!</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I mean, today was the biggest day</br>in Stratton's history,</i></br>

Hey, Jordan!</br>
</p>
<p>
- Welcome.</br>- Steve here yet?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>This was the day that we</br>launched the Steve Madden IPO.</i></br>

<p>
You had a minute.</br>

<p>
And today you needed to</br>clean the fish bowl? Today?</br>
</p>

Okay. Nice to meet you.</br>

<p>
Hey, everybody, listen up!</br>

<i>A real wolf pit,</br>which is exactly how I liked it.</i></br>

The great American cobbler.</br>

<i>Red-hot ladies footwear Impresario.</i></br>
</p>

<i>And thanks to Donnie,</br>we were taking his company public.</i></br>

<p>
<i>Stratton Oakmont was crawling</br>out of the primordial ooze.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Pond scum no more.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
That's why they gotta</br>see your face.</br>
</p>
<p>
You get them fired up so they push</br>the shit out of this stock. Okay?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>And not only that,</br>Donnie and I secretly owned</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>85% of Steve Madden Shoes,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>which legally speaking</br>was a big no-no,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>but we'd get filthy fucking rich</br>if our troops got behind it.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Our job was to get them worked up.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>- But not too worked up.</i></br>- Shh.</br>
</p>
<p>
Hello. If, uh...</br>
</p>
<p>
For those of you who don't know me,</br>uh...</br>
</p>
<p>
My name's Steve Madden.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, we know who you are.</br>
</p>
<p>
Your name is on the box.</br>
</p>
<p>
Get the shoes. Show them the shoes.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Show them the shoes.</br>- Okay. Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
Anyway, you know,</br>this shoe is pretty cool.</br>
</p>
<p>
This is the Mary Lou, which is really</br>the shoe that put me on the map.</br>
</p>
<p>
Without it, I wouldn't be here.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's a fat girls' shoe!</br>
</p>
<p>
Believe it or not...</br>Believe it or not though,</br>
</p>
<p>
the Mary Lou is actually the same</br>
</p>
<p>
as the Mary Jane, but</br>it's black leather.</br>
</p>
<p>
Whoa, whoa, whoa!</br>
</p>
<p>
Fight back! Come on!</br>Where you at? Where you at?</br>
</p>
<p>
All right!</br>
</p>
<p>
Let's give it up for Steve Madden</br>and his awesome Mary Lou!</br>
</p>
<p>
Hold that up. Hold that up.</br>Hold that up proud!</br>
</p>
<p>
Give him a round of applause!</br>

</p>
<p>
You having a good</br>afternoon or what?</br>
</p>
<p>
I wanna take a moment</br>and tell you why Steve here is so</br>
</p>
<p>
absolutely off the fucking wall.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's because this man</br>
</p>
<p>
is a creative genius.</br>
</p>
<p>
This ability, this gift</br>
</p>
<p>
that Steve has,</br>
</p>
<p>
it goes beyond just</br>
</p>
<p>
spotting the hottest shoe trends.</br>
</p>
<p>
Steve's power is that</br>he creates trends.</br>
</p>
<p>
You understand?</br>
</p>
<p>
Artists like Steve come along</br>once every decade.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm talking Giorgio Armani,</br>Gianni Versace, Coco Chanel,</br>
</p>
<p>
Yves Saint Laurent.</br>
</p>
<p>
Steve, come over here for a second.</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't think you all realize</br>
</p>
<p>
that Steve Madden</br>
</p>
<p>
is the hottest person</br>in the women's shoe industry,</br>
</p>

We should be</br>on our hands and knees right now,</br>
</p>
<p>
getting ready to suck this guy off!</br>
</p>
<p>
Like this! Okay?</br>
</p>
<p>
I wanna suck you off, Steve!</br>
</p>
<p>
Everyone's gonna suck you off!</br>
</p>
<p>
This is our golden ticket</br>
</p>
<p>
to the fucking chocolate factory</br>right here!</br>
</p>
<p>
And I wanna meet</br>
</p>
<p>
Willy fucking Wonka, okay?</br>
</p>
<p>
I wanna be with the</br>fucking Oompa Loompas like this!</br>
</p>
<p>
All right, get off this fucking stage!</br>Get out of here.</br>
</p>
<p>
All right, I want you all</br>to focus for a second.</br>
</p>
<p>
See those little black boxes?</br>
</p>
<p>
They're called telephones.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm gonna let you in on a little</br>secret about these telephones.</br>
</p>
<p>
They're not gonna dial themselves.</br>Okay?</br>
</p>
<p>
Without you, they're just</br>worthless hunks of plastic.</br>
</p>
<p>
Like a loaded M16 without a trained</br>Marine to pull the trigger.</br>
</p>
<p>
And in the case of the telephone,</br>
</p>
<p>
it's up to each and</br>every one of you,</br>
</p>
<p>
my highly-trained Strattonites.</br>
</p>
<p>
My killers!</br>
</p>
<p>
My killers,</br>who will not take no for an answer!</br>
</p>
<p>
My fucking warriors,</br>
</p>
<p>
who will not hang up the phone</br>
</p>
<p>
until their client either buys</br>
</p>
<p>
or fucking dies!</br>
</p>
<p>
Let me tell you something.</br>
</p>
<p>
There is no nobility in poverty.</br>
</p>
<p>
I have been a rich man</br>and I have been a poor man.</br>
</p>
<p>
And I choose rich</br>every fucking time.</br>
</p>
<p>
Because at least as a rich man,</br>
</p>
<p>
when I have to face my problems,</br>
</p>
<p>
I show up in the back of a limo,</br>
</p>
<p>
wearing a $2,000 suit</br>
</p>
<p>
and a $40,000 gold fucking watch!</br>
</p>
<p>
Duke it out! Hit him!</br>
</p>
<p>
Get the fuck off me!</br>
</p>
<p>
And if anyone here</br>thinks I'm superficial</br>
</p>
<p>
or materialistic,</br>
</p>
<p>
go get a job at fucking McDonald's,</br>
</p>
<p>
'cause that's where</br>you fucking belong!</br>
</p>
<p>
But before you depart</br>this room full of winners,</br>
</p>
<p>
I want you to take a good look</br>
</p>
<p>
at the person next to you. Go on.</br>
</p>
<p>
Because sometime in</br>the not-so-distant future,</br>
</p>
<p>
you're gonna be pulling</br>up to a red light</br>
</p>
<p>
in your beat-up old fucking Pinto,</br>
</p>
<p>
and that person's gonna be</br>pulling up right alongside you</br>
</p>
<p>
in their brand new Porsche</br>
</p>
<p>
with their beautiful</br>wife by their side,</br>
</p>
<p>
who's got big voluptuous tits.</br>
</p>
<p>
And who're you gonna</br>be sitting next to?</br>
</p>
<p>
Some disgusting wildebeest</br>
</p>
<p>
with three days of razor-stubble,</br>
</p>
<p>
in a sleeveless muumuu,</br>
</p>
<p>
crammed in next to you</br>in a carload full of groceries</br>
</p>
<p>
from the fucking Price Club!</br>
</p>
<p>
That's who you're gonna</br>be sitting next to!</br>
</p>
<p>
So you listen to me</br>and you listen well.</br>
</p>
<p>
Are you behind on your</br>credit card bills?</br>
</p>
<p>
Good! Pick up the phone</br>and start dialing!</br>
</p>
<p>
Is your landlord ready</br>to evict you? Good!</br>
</p>
<p>
Pick up the phone</br>and start dialing!</br>
</p>
<p>
Does your girlfriend think</br>you're a fucking worthless loser?</br>
</p>
<p>
Good! Pick up the</br>phone and start dialing!</br>
</p>
<p>
I want you to deal</br>with your problems</br>
</p>
<p>
by becoming rich!</br>
</p>
<p>
All you have to do today</br>
</p>
<p>
is pick up that phone</br>
</p>
<p>
and speak the words</br>that I have taught you.</br>
</p>
<p>
And I will make you richer</br>
</p>
<p>
than the most powerful CEO</br>
</p>
<p>
in the United States</br>of fucking America!</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah!</br>
</p>
<p>
Fuck, yeah!</br>
</p>
<p>
I want you to go out there</br>
</p>
<p>
and I want you to ram</br>
</p>
<p>
Steve Madden stock</br>down your clients' throats</br>
</p>
<p>
until they fucking choke on it!</br>
</p>
<p>
Till they choke on it and they buy</br>
</p>
<p>
100,000 shares! That's what I want.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah! Fuck, yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
You be ferocious!</br>
</p>
<p>
- You be relentless!</br>- Yeah!</br>
</p>
<p>
You be telephone</br>fucking terrorists!</br>
</p>
<p>
Now let's knock this motherfucker</br>out of the park!</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>At 1:00 p.m., we opened</br>the stock for sale at $4.50 a share.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>By 1:03, it was over $18.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Even the big Wall Street firms</br>were buying.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Of the two million shares</br>offered for sale,</br>
</p>
<p>
a million belonged to me, held in</br>phony accounts by my ratholes.</br>
</p>
<p>
Now once the price hit</br>the high teens...</br>
</p>
<p>
You know what? Who gives a shit?</br>
</p>
<p>
As always, the point is this.</br>
</p>
<p>
$22 million in three fucking hours!</br>
</p>
<p>
Can you believe this shit?</br>
</p>
<p>
- I fucking love this, baby!</br>- It's amazing!</br>
</p>
<p>
Jordan!</br>
</p>
<p>
Barry Kleinman's on the phone</br>
</p>
<p>
- from Future Video.</br>- Who?</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't know.</br>He shot at your wedding.</br>
</p>
<p>
He says it's urgent.</br>
</p>
<p>
Urgent?</br>Who the fuck is Barry Kleinman?</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, my God, you wanna marry me?</br>
</p>
<p>
You're in love with me?</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah. Go fuck your cousin!</br>
</p>
<p>
Hey, Barry, what's up?</br>
</p>
<p>
Listen, I got this subpoena.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Subpoena? What the fuck</br>are you talking about?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, the FBI, they want a copy</br>
</p>
<p>
of your wedding video.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>The fucking FBI?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
- You fucking kidding me?</br><i>- Listen to me.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>His name is Denham.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>He's an agent with</br>the New York office.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>What's his problem?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>He's a Boy Scout. He thinks</br>you're fucking Gordon Gekko.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
What does he want</br>with my wedding video?</br>
</p>
<p>
It's like an invasion</br>of my privacy.</br>
</p>
<p>
You know what I'm saying?</br>It's like...</br>
</p>
<p>
It's intrusive, you know.</br>
</p>
<p>
He's got pictures of your</br>whole inner fucking circle.</br>
</p>
<p>
Pictures, names of the people.</br>
</p>
<p>
You know what he's trying to do?</br>
</p>
<p>
Exactly what he's doing.</br>Look at yourself.</br>
</p>
<p>
He's trying to rattle you,</br>
</p>
<p>
he's trying to rattle</br>your old lady,</br>
</p>
<p>
so she nags you</br>until you become a fucking witness.</br>
</p>
<p>
He wants me to rat on myself?</br>
</p>
<p>
He wants me</br>to give information about my...</br>
</p>
<p>
Listen. The good fucking news is,</br>
</p>
<p>
you know I know everybody downtown,</br>
</p>
<p>
I call up the Justice Department,</br>the DEA,</br>
</p>
<p>
nobody even knows you fucking</br>exist, so calm down!</br>
</p>
<p>
They don't know I exist?</br>
</p>
<p>
- No.</br>- That's good.</br>
</p>
<p>
But you...</br>
</p>
<p>
You know who he is, right?</br>
</p>
<p>
- Yeah.</br>- So, if I just wanted to get</br>
</p>
<p>
some more information,</br>just find out what he knows,</br>
</p>
<p>
you could go to his house, right?</br>
</p>
<p>
Tap his phones a</br>little bit, bug him.</br>
</p>
<p>
You could get some information...</br>
</p>
<p>
You don't fuck with</br>these guys like that.</br>
</p>
<p>
You don't fuck with them like that.</br>
</p>
<p>
What are you, nuts or something?</br>
</p>
<p>
This is what you fucking do.</br>What do I pay you for?</br>
</p>
<p>
I have a fucking P.I. license, you know?</br>I make a living at this.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm not a cop anymore.</br>
</p>
<p>
They'll take my fucking license</br>away from me, all right?</br>
</p>
<p>
Okay.</br>
</p>
<p>
Okay, if I can't do that,</br>can I just...</br>
</p>
<p>
Can I give the guy a call?</br>
</p>
<p>
- Why? Is that...</br>- Jordan. Jordan.</br>
</p>
<p>
Do me a favor?</br>
</p>
<p>
The only one who calls this guy</br>is your fucking lawyer.</br>
</p>
<p>
I can't call him, right?</br>
</p>
<p>
- It's against the rules?</br>- I told you,</br>
</p>
<p>
whatever the fuck you say to him,</br>
</p>
<p>
he's gonna use against you.</br>Don't you understand?</br>
</p>
<p>
He's smart, you're dumb.</br>
</p>
<p>
Fucking bullshit.</br>
</p>
<p>
Are we fucking talking tonight,</br>
</p>
<p>
or are you gonna get schwacked?</br>
</p>
<p>
The last time you took</br>these fucking pills,</br>
</p>
<p>
you put your head in the fucking</br>macaroni. I had to pick it up.</br>
</p>
<p>
All right.</br>
</p>
<p>
Okay, I won't call him.</br>
</p>
<p>
Hey, fellas! Come on board.</br>
</p>
<p>
The plank's right around there.</br>
</p>
<p>
Welcome!</br>
</p>
<p>
Whoo! What a nice day.</br>
</p>
<p>
Hey.</br>
</p>
<p>
Welcome aboard.</br>
</p>
<p>
Jordan. Welcome aboard the <i>Naomi.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Pleasure to meet you.</br>
</p>
<p>
Agent Denham. This is Agent Hughes.</br>
</p>
<p>
Hi, how are you?</br>
</p>
<p>
Let me introduce you. This is Nicole,</br>Heidi. Come on. Don't be shy.</br>
</p>
<p>
What are you guys all shy for?</br>Don't be scared.</br>
</p>
<p>
These are friends of Stratton.</br>
</p>
<p>
- It's a pleasure.</br>- Hello.</br>
</p>
<p>
Um...</br>
</p>
<p>
Your message said</br>that you wanted to speak privately.</br>
</p>
<p>
Right. I do want to</br>speak privately.</br>
</p>
<p>
Give us a minute, huh, ladies?</br>
</p>
<p>
Let me know if I can</br>get you anything.</br>
</p>
<p>
We'd be happy to help.</br>
</p>
<p>
You guys hungry?</br>
</p>
<p>
Want something to eat?</br>
</p>
<p>
Got some pasta, shrimp, lobster.</br>
</p>
<p>
I got whiskey.</br>Any kind of booze you want.</br>
</p>
<p>
You know what?</br>The Bureau doesn't allow us</br>
</p>
<p>
to drink while we're at sea.</br>
</p>
<p>
Duh! Of course.</br>
</p>
<p>
Ever been on one of these before?</br>
</p>
<p>
A boat?</br>
</p>
<p>
I learned how to</br>sail when I was six.</br>
</p>
<p>
No shit. Is that right? Really?</br>
</p>
<p>
On one like this, though?</br>
</p>
<p>
I had the whole front extended in</br>order to fit the chopper up there.</br>
</p>
<p>
See that?</br>
</p>
<p>
Anyway, this is for you.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's a complete list of every</br>person that was at my wedding.</br>
</p>
<p>
I understand you wanted</br>the whole wedding video.</br>
</p>
<p>
Figured this would help</br>expedite the whole process, right?</br>
</p>
<p>
- There you go.</br>- Look,</br>
</p>
<p>
my point is that</br>
</p>
<p>
I know you're</br>investigating Stratton.</br>
</p>
<p>
But for the life of me,</br>I can't figure out why.</br>
</p>
<p>
I know we're a little unorthodox,</br>we're a little</br>
</p>
<p>
loud in the way we do things.</br>But you gotta understand,</br>
</p>
<p>
we're the new guys on the block,</br>you know,</br>
</p>
<p>
we're trying to make</br>a name for ourselves.</br>
</p>
<p>
But I want you to</br>understand, we don't</br>
</p>
<p>
do anything illegal.</br>
</p>
<p>
Whatsoever.</br>
</p>
<p>
I mean, you could talk to the SEC.</br>
</p>
<p>
They were at my office 15 times</br>over the last six months.</br>
</p>
<p>
I mean, I got...</br>I got nothing to hide.</br>
</p>
<p>
Well, you know the SEC is</br>a civil regulatory agency.</br>
</p>
<p>
We pursue criminal activities.</br>
</p>
<p>
Exactly! You go after</br>real criminals, which</br>
</p>
<p>
makes me wonder what the hell</br>you're investigating me for?</br>
</p>
<p>
I mean, honestly...</br>
</p>
<p>
What is it that you think</br>that we did or do? I don't get it.</br>
</p>
<p>
Well, I...</br>
</p>
<p>
Look, Jordan, I can't discuss</br>an ongoing investigation.</br>
</p>
<p>
No, I get that. No, I understand.</br>
</p>
<p>
With that said...</br>
</p>
<p>
This case got dumped on my desk...</br>
</p>
<p>
- Did it?</br>- You know, by a higher-up</br>
</p>
<p>
who needs to make a show</br>
</p>
<p>
of looking into the new company</br>on the block,</br>
</p>
<p>
- with all the press and everything.</br>- New loud guys.</br>
</p>
<p>
And then I end up being the schmuck</br>
</p>
<p>
who does the looking. Exactly.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's just, you know...</br>It bothers me.</br>
</p>
<p>
We're the new guy. We're the one</br>
</p>
<p>
that's banging on Wall Street's door.</br>I mean, you should...</br>
</p>
<p>
You should see what's going</br>on at the bigger firms.</br>
</p>
<p>
I mean, I know all the information.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's true! Goldman,</br>Lehman Brothers, Merrill...</br>
</p>
<p>
Collateralized debt obligations?</br>
</p>
<p>
This Internet stock bullshit?</br>
</p>
<p>
I mean, it's a fucking travesty.</br>
</p>
<p>
I could take you step-by-step</br>
</p>
<p>
through what exactly is occurring.</br>
</p>
<p>
All you have to do is ask.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm available.</br>
</p>
<p>
- That's exactly what I wanted to hear.</br>- Mmm-hmm.</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't see why a</br>little sitdown like this</br>
</p>
<p>
can't be profitable</br>for the both of us.</br>
</p>
<p>
It should. Right?</br>It should profit the both of us.</br>
</p>
<p>
- It should.</br>- Look.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm gonna give you</br>my personal line.</br>
</p>
<p>
Five days a week,</br>you just call me, feel free.</br>
</p>
<p>
- I'll do that.</br>- Great.</br>
</p>
<p>
Are you sure you guys don't</br>want something to drink?</br>
</p>
<p>
You're not hungry? Nothing?</br>
</p>
<p>
- Nothing? No?</br>- Oh, no.</br>
</p>
<p>
Let me ask you,</br>
</p>
<p>
and if you don't wanna</br>get too personal,</br>
</p>
<p>
- just tell me to shut up at any time.</br>- Oh.</br>
</p>
<p>
Did you try to get</br>your broker's license at one time?</br>
</p>
<p>
Did I hear that right? Were you</br>trying to take a stab at Wall Street?</br>
</p>
<p>
- No?</br>- Who you been talking to?</br>
</p>
<p>
Who the fuck you been talking to?</br>
</p>
<p>
Well, you're investigating me.</br>
</p>
<p>
I hear things.</br>
</p>
<p>
You know what I mean?</br>
</p>
<p>
You ever think about</br>what would've happened</br>
</p>
<p>
if you would have</br>stayed the course?</br>
</p>
<p>
You know what?</br>When I'm riding home on the subway</br>
</p>
<p>
and my balls are fucking sweating,</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm wearing the same suit</br>three days in a row...</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, you bet I do.</br>
</p>
<p>
I've thought about it before.</br>Who wouldn't, right?</br>
</p>
<p>
Right, who fucking wouldn't?</br>
</p>
<p>
What do you get...</br>
</p>
<p>
Another personal question,</br>no need to answer...</br>
</p>
<p>
No, that's all right, Jordan.</br>
</p>
<p>
What do you pull in? 50, 60K?</br>Something like that?</br>
</p>
<p>
- A year? In the ballpark?</br>- Oh.</br>
</p>
<p>
Well, I...</br>
</p>
<p>
Let's put it this way.</br>
</p>
<p>
You get a free handgun</br>
</p>
<p>
when you sign up for the Bureau.</br>
</p>
<p>
No, but it fucking pisses me off.</br>You know what I mean?</br>
</p>
<p>
You think about the people</br>that built this country,</br>
</p>
<p>
hardworking people like you.</br>
</p>
<p>
Firefighters, teachers, FBI agents.</br>
</p>
<p>
End of the day, you guys get</br>fucking skinned alive financially.</br>
</p>
<p>
It fucking makes me angry.</br>
</p>
<p>
Now the one thing about Wall Street</br>and this market is,</br>
</p>
<p>
for me, I feel</br>
</p>
<p>
it's good to give back.</br>You know, there's...</br>
</p>
<p>
There are situations where I can</br>
</p>
<p>
make those situations better</br>for people. You know?</br>
</p>
<p>
You know what I mean.</br>
</p>
<p>
Opportunity</br>
</p>
<p>
is everything.</br>
</p>
<p>
Exactly.</br>
</p>
<p>
Take for example,</br>I got this one kid, right?</br>
</p>
<p>
Went to school for environmental</br>science, something like that.</br>
</p>
<p>
He was bogged down</br>by student loans.</br>
</p>
<p>
Turns out, his mother needed</br>triple bypass surgery.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Jesus.</br>- Right. Horrible situation.</br>
</p>
<p>
Sure.</br>
</p>
<p>
But we got him into the market</br>
</p>
<p>
at the right time</br>and chose the right stock.</br>
</p>
<p>
We gave him the right guidance.</br>
</p>
<p>
Boom! Overnight,</br>changed his entire life.</br>
</p>
<p>
Got to put his mother into</br>
</p>
<p>
the best hospital in New York City.</br>
</p>
<p>
It didn't work out for her,</br>
</p>
<p>
granted, she passed</br>away, unfortunately.</br>
</p>
<p>
But we gave him that opportunity.</br>
</p>
<p>
You know what I'm saying?</br>
</p>
<p>
It's just about setting</br>up the right team,</br>
</p>
<p>
and then overnight</br>your life can change.</br>
</p>
<p>
What does... What does an intern...</br>
</p>
<p>
What does an intern</br>make in a deal like that?</br>
</p>
<p>
Well, in that situation,</br>
</p>
<p>
in that particular trade,</br>and it was one trade,</br>
</p>
<p>
north of half a million dollars.</br>
</p>
<p>
And I'd do that for</br>anybody, you know,</br>
</p>
<p>
anybody that needs</br>the proper guidance.</br>
</p>
<p>
Can you say that again,</br>
</p>
<p>
just the way you said it?</br>
</p>
<p>
Just the same way.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh.</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't know what</br>you're talking about.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, come on!</br>You know what I'm talking about.</br>
</p>
<p>
I think what Jordan</br>just did is he...</br>
</p>
<p>
- If I'm not mistaken...</br>- No.</br>
</p>
<p>
you just tried to</br>bribe a federal officer.</br>
</p>
<p>
No, technically I</br>didn't bribe anybody.</br>
</p>
<p>
No, no, that's not the conversation</br>I heard, Jordan.</br>
</p>
<p>
No, no, according to</br>the U.S. criminal code,</br>
</p>
<p>
there needs to be an</br>exact dollar figure</br>
</p>
<p>
- for the exchange of services.</br>- Oh!</br>
</p>
<p>
That would not hold</br>up in a court of law.</br>
</p>
<p>
Nah, it's not howl heard it.</br>
</p>
<p>
No, no, no, that's the truth.</br>But I want to tell you this.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
The same gentleman that told me</br>
</p>
<p>
that you tried to get</br>your broker's license</br>
</p>
<p>
also told me that</br>you are a straight arrow.</br>
</p>
<p>
He ran a security check on me.</br>
</p>
<p>
Well...</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, when you sail</br>on a boat fit for a Bond villain,</br>
</p>
<p>
sometimes you need to</br>play the part. Right?</br>
</p>
<p>
I think it's time you both</br>get the fuck off my boat.</br>
</p>
<p>
What do you say? Hmm?</br>
</p>
<p>
You know, Jordan,</br>I'll tell you something.</br>
</p>
<p>
Most of the Wall Street jackasses</br>that I bust,</br>
</p>
<p>
they're to the manor born.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Is that right?</br>- Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
Their fathers are douchebags,</br>
</p>
<p>
just like their</br>fathers before them.</br>
</p>
<p>
But you...</br>
</p>
<p>
You, Jordan,</br>you got this way all on your own.</br>
</p>
<p>
Did I?</br>
</p>
<p>
- Good for you, little man.</br>- Little man?</br>
</p>
<p>
Good for you.</br>
</p>
<p>
Me, the little man?</br>
</p>
<p>
And let me tell you something.</br>
</p>
<p>
Let me tell you something else.</br>
</p>
<p>
Honestly,</br>I'm not bullshitting here,</br>
</p>
<p>
this is one of the nicest boats</br>
</p>
<p>
- that I've ever been on, I gotta tell you.</br>- I bet it is.</br>
</p>
<p>
And you know</br>what I was just thinking, too?</br>
</p>
<p>
The fucking hero that I'm</br>gonna be back at the office</br>
</p>
<p>
when the Bureau seizes</br>this fucking boat.</br>
</p>
<p>
Because, I mean,</br>fuckety-fuck-fuck, Jordan,</br>
</p>
<p>
look at this thing!</br>
</p>
<p>
It's beautiful!</br>
</p>
<p>
And you got the beautiful</br>girls there. It's wonderful.</br>
</p>
<p>
All right, get the</br>fuck off my boat.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm sure we'll be seeing each other</br>
</p>
<p>
- real soon.</br>- I'm sure.</br>
</p>
<p>
Good luck on that subway ride home</br>
</p>
<p>
to your miserable,</br>ugly fucking wives.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm gonna have Heidi lick some</br>caviar off my balls in the meantime.</br>
</p>
<p>
Hey, you guys want to take some</br>lobsters for your ride home?</br>
</p>
<p>
Fucking miserable pricks,</br>I know you can't afford them!</br>
</p>
<p>
Fucking cheap fucks.</br>
</p>
<p>
Fucking miserable pricks.</br>
</p>
<p>
Hey, fellas! Look what I</br>found in my pocket! Look!</br>
</p>
<p>
A year's salary right here.</br>
</p>
<p>
You know what I call them?</br>Fun coupons!</br>
</p>
<p>
See that!</br>
</p>
<p>
They're fun coupons!</br>
</p>
<p>
Switzerland?</br>What the fuck is in Switzerland?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Swiss fucking banks, that's what.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>It was ass-covering time.</br>I had to hide my money.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Enter Rugrat.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>He knew this Swiss banker</br>from law school.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
That's for European pussy!</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>But he was in Geneva.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>And there was no way</br>I was gonna make that flight sober.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>So I knew if I took my drugs right,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I could sleep through</br>the entire flight.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>But I had to take them just right.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>At 4:00 p.m., I popped</br>a few more ludes,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>which started kicking</br>in by the time</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I finished my sales meeting.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>My tingle phase.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>By dinner, I popped a few more</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>on top of some cocktails</br>and a Valium or two.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>My slur phase.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>By 8:30, I took a few more ludes</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>and pretty much lost</br>all my motor skills.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>This was the drool phase.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>And by 10:00, I didn't know</br>who or what the fuck I was.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>The amnesia phase.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>We boarded the plane</br>just before midnight.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Wow! Look at you!</br>
</p>
<p>
- You're beautiful.</br>- Excuse me, sir.</br>
</p>
<p>
His sleeping pills just kicked in.</br>He's all right.</br>
</p>
<p>
May I see your</br>boarding passes, sir?</br>
</p>
<p>
We have the boarding passes.</br>
</p>
<p>
Jesus Christ, I wanna fuck her.</br>
</p>
<p>
Hey! Fucking relax.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, my God! You got your</br>hand on my fucking cock!</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't. Cut it out.</br>
</p>
<p>
He's got his hand on my dick again.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm just trying to buckle you up.</br>
</p>
<p>
You got your hand on his dick?</br>
</p>
<p>
You gotta stop doing that</br>in public places.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, my God. Take it off!</br>
</p>
<p>
Take it off!</br>
</p>
<p>
I heard there's a treasure map</br>under here.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Stop! I know, miss.</br>- Excuse me, sir.</br>
</p>
<p>
Please sit down.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Watch it.</br>- Go back to your seat, please.</br>
</p>
<p>
- What are you upset about?</br>- Please go back to your seat.</br>
</p>
<p>
I will have to call the captain.</br>
</p>
<p>
Please, sir, please, sir. Sit down.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Please sit down!</br>- Ow!</br>
</p>
<p>
- I'm going! Stop.</br>- Okay, sorry.</br>
</p>
<p>
We apologize.</br>We're gonna go to sleep.</br>
</p>
<p>
Question. I wanna</br>ask you a question.</br>
</p>
<p>
Fasten your seat belt, sir.</br>
</p>
<p>
We cannot take off</br>if you haven't fastened</br>
</p>
<p>
- your seat belt.</br>- I'm really horny, too.</br>
</p>
<p>
Sit down. Fasten it.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Right. Okay, I'll sit down...</br>- I will do it for you.</br>
</p>
<p>
- What?</br>- I'll do it for you.</br>
</p>
<p>
You gotta speak English.</br>
</p>
<p>
We don't understand</br>this language you're speaking.</br>
</p>
<p>
I will help him with his seat belt.</br>
</p>
<p>
- You gotta put it on right.</br>- Sit back. Sit back, sir.</br>
</p>
<p>
- There you go.</br>- All right. I'll just lean back...</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Bitte, Hilfe!</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Jesus Christ!</br>
</p>
<p>
Fuck!</br>
</p>
<p>
Donnie...</br>
</p>
<p>
Donnie, this isn't funny.</br>You gotta untie me, buddy.</br>
</p>
<p>
I can't untie you.</br>
</p>
<p>
The captain tied you up.</br>
</p>
<p>
He almost fucking tasered you.</br>
</p>
<p>
Why?</br>
</p>
<p>
Why?</br>
</p>
<p>
He's got a fear of flying.</br>
</p>
<p>
Ah!</br>
</p>
<p>
He's very nervous</br>on planes, I'm sorry,</br>
</p>
<p>
it's not you, sweetheart,</br>don't beat yourself up.</br>
</p>
<p>
Easy, easy. He's fine.</br>He's just a nervous flyer.</br>
</p>
<p>
You were screaming at people.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, fuck off.</br>
</p>
<p>
You were on the floor</br>rolling around and shit.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, Jesus.</br>
</p>
<p>
You called the captain the N-word.</br>
</p>
<p>
I called the captain the N-word?</br>
</p>
<p>
- Yeah, he was very upset.</br>- Really?</br>
</p>
<p>
- Luckily we're in first class.</br>- Jesus.</br>
</p>
<p>
Jesus Christ, I think</br>you have a fucking drug problem.</br>
</p>
<p>
Where are the ludes?</br>
</p>
<p>
Where are the ludes?</br>
</p>
<p>
They're up my ass.</br>Don't worry about it.</br>
</p>
<p>
- I got it.</br>- Okay.</br>
</p>
<p>
Thank God.</br>
</p>
<p>
Jesus Christ, what are we gonna do</br>
</p>
<p>
when we get to Switzerland, buddy?</br>
</p>
<p>
This is bad.</br>
</p>
<p>
Fucking things are against my</br>chest. I can't breathe.</br>
</p>
<p>
Come on, do something</br>to calm me down. Please.</br>
</p>
<p>
Okay, shut the fuck up.</br>Shut the fuck up.</br>
</p>
<p>
Okay. Shh! Shh!</br>
</p>
<p>
That's good.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Go to sleep.</br>- Rub it harder, buddy.</br>
</p>
<p>
You're all right.</br>
</p>
<p>
We all love you. Shut the fuck up!</br>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Belfort,</br>
</p>
<p>
you're free to go.</br>
</p>
<p>
Really?</br>
</p>
<p>
Whoo!</br>
</p>
<p>
- Hey, Donnie.</br>- Yeah?</br>
</p>
<p>
When we get out there,</br>try not to act like yourself.</br>
</p>
<p>
Okay? Let's make Geneva an</br>asshole-free Donnie zone, all right?</br>
</p>
<p>
What are you</br>fucking coming at me for?</br>
</p>
<p>
Hey, listen. The only reason</br>you're sitting in this limo</br>
</p>
<p>
and not in a Swiss jail</br>is because of my friend. Okay?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Hilfe!</i></br>
</p>
<p>
We're here. We're here.</br>Everyone calm down.</br>
</p>
<p>
Jordan Belfort!</br>
</p>
<p>
At last.</br>
</p>
<p>
Nicholas has told me</br>so much about you.</br>
</p>
<p>
Jordan, Jean Jacques Saurel.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Pleasure to make your acquaintance.</br>- Nice to meet you.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's a joke.</br>
</p>
<p>
You'll understand</br>when you're in the fucking seat.</br>
</p>
<p>
You need a bigger couch.</br>For guests.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.</br>I don't understand. I'm sorry.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm curious about</br>your bank secrecy laws here.</br>
</p>
<p>
Uh... Wait. Yes.</br>Excusez-moi, Jordan.</br>
</p>
<p>
Swiss custom requires</br>10 minutes of...</br>
</p>
<p>
Blah, blah, blah.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Chit chat.</br>- Yeah, chit chat, thank you.</br>
</p>
<p>
before business can be discussed.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
Of course.</br>
</p>
<p>
Let's get down to it.</br>What would you like to know?</br>
</p>
<p>
Under what circumstances</br>would you be obligated</br>
</p>
<p>
to cooperate with an FBI</br>
</p>
<p>
or a U.S. Justice Department</br>investigation, for example?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Ca depend.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Ca depend?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Oui.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Ca depend on what, exactly?</br>
</p>
<p>
Whether America plans</br>to invade Switzerland</br>
</p>
<p>
in the coming months.</br>
</p>
<p>
Shall I check if tanks are</br>rolling down the Rue de la Croy?</br>
</p>
<p>
- Yes. Rue de la Croix.</br>- Croix. Croix.</br>
</p>
<p>
Not Croy. Not Rue de la Croy.</br>It's Croix.</br>
</p>
<p>
See, this is what he used to do</br>back in law school. Check me.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Champagne. Champagne.</br>- Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, yeah. French</br>fries, pommes frites.</br>
</p>
<p>
- And that kind of stuff.</br>- That's funny.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>What I'm asking, you Swiss dick,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>is are you going to fuck me over?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I understand</br>perfectly, you American shit.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
The only way</br>the Banque Réal de Genéve</br>
</p>
<p>
would cooperate</br>with a foreign legal body</br>
</p>
<p>
is if the crime being pursued</br>
</p>
<p>
is also a crime in Switzerland.</br>
</p>
<p>
But there are very few Swiss laws</br>which apply to your practices.</br>
</p>
<p>
Hmm.</br>
</p>
<p>
From a financial standpoint,</br>
</p>
<p>
you are now</br>
</p>
<p>
in heaven.</br>
</p>
<p>
See, I told you he was</br>fantastic, right?</br>
</p>
<p>
If the U.S. Justice Department</br>sent us a subpoena, it would become</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>papier toilette.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
We would wipe our ass with it.</br>
</p>
<p>
Unless, of course, it</br>was an investigation</br>
</p>
<p>
into stock fraud,</br>
</p>
<p>
which is a crime here in</br>Switzerland, if I'm correct.</br>
</p>
<p>
Then there would have to</br>be <i>coopération</i> on your part,</br>
</p>
<p>
- if I'm not mistaken.</br>- Yes.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yes, we would. Mmm-hmm.</br>
</p>
<p>
Assuming the account is</br>under your name.</br>
</p>
<p>
If it were</br>
</p>
<p>
another name,</br>
</p>
<p>
a friend's, camarade...</br>
</p>
<p>
Cousin?</br>
</p>
<p>
- Relative?</br>- Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
Hmm.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Was that yodeling I just heard</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>or did you just say</br>what I thought you said?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Yes. Yes.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>He's telling me</br>to use a fucking rathole.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>But a U.S. rathole would never get</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>into Switzerland</br>with all that money.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>What I needed was a rathole</br>with a European passport.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Jordan.</br>
</p>
<p>
Hey. How's my favorite aunt, huh?</br>
</p>
<p>
Welcome. Was the traffic terrible?</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, no, not at all.</br>
</p>
<p>
Jordan, come in.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Thank God Aunt Emma didn't</br>need too much convincing.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Turned out the British weren't</br>too different from the Swiss.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Money talks and</br>bullshit takes the bus.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>How do you say</br>"rathole" in British?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
If you get into any</br>trouble whatsoever,</br>
</p>
<p>
I'll come forth immediately.</br>I'll say that I duped you.</br>
</p>
<p>
That I promise.</br>
</p>
<p>
Risk is what keeps us young,</br>isn't it, darling?</br>
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I wonder</br>
</p>
<p>
if you let money get the</br>best of you, my love.</br>
</p>
<p>
Among</br>
</p>
<p>
other substances.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's that obvious, huh?</br>
</p>
<p>
It's chilly, darling,</br>and you're sweating bullets.</br>
</p>
<p>
What can I say? I'm...</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm a drug addict.</br>
</p>
<p>
I really am.</br>
</p>
<p>
Cocaine, pills.</br>
</p>
<p>
Whatever it is, I'll fucking do it.</br>
</p>
<p>
Now that's the truth.</br>
</p>
<p>
I mean...</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm a sex addict, too.</br>
</p>
<p>
Well, there are worse things</br>to be addicted to than sex.</br>
</p>
<p>
Jesus, why am I telling</br>you all this? Why am I...</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm sorry.</br>
</p>
<p>
Because I'm very easy to talk to.</br>
</p>
<p>
- You are. You are easy to talk to.</br>- Mmm.</br>
</p>
<p>
I suppose it's...</br>
</p>
<p>
Just my job, you know.</br>
</p>
<p>
All these people dependent on me.</br>
</p>
<p>
Tens of millions of dollars</br>at stake, you know.</br>
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I feel like I...</br>
</p>
<p>
I've bitten off more</br>than I can chew, you know.</br>
</p>
<p>
You're a man with large appetites.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Is she fucking hitting on me?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, I am.</br>
</p>
<p>
I suppose I put that</br>on myself though, right?</br>
</p>
<p>
My decision.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's just hard to...</br>
</p>
<p>
Hard to learn to control</br>the anxiety sometimes, you know?</br>
</p>
<p>
You know, to...</br>
</p>
<p>
Learn to relax and let go and...</br>
</p>
<p>
To release the tension.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>She is hitting on me.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Holy shit!</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, to release the tension.</br>
</p>
<p>
I suppose we, uh...</br>
</p>
<p>
We all just need to learn, uh...</br>
</p>
<p>
Learn to do what comes</br>naturally in life, you know?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Is he fucking hitting on me?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Stability, dear.</br>
</p>
<p>
Family.</br>
</p>
<p>
You take care of my niece, my love.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'll take care of</br>everything over here.</br>
</p>
<p>
Deal.</br>
</p>
<p>
Come on! There you go.</br>
</p>
<p>
Whoo!</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>We had, literally,</br>a fuckload of money.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Aunt Emma could never</br>carry all this by herself.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>So I thought to myself,</br>who else has a European passport?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Brad, you're making this</br>too fucking tight!</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Now Brad, as a</br>successful drug dealer,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>spent his winters in</br>the south of France,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>which is where he met</br>his wife, Chantalle,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>a stripper of Slovenian origin</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>born, in of all places,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Switzerland.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Well, this is fucked.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh. No shit.</br>
</p>
<p>
Like, this will take</br>her like 50 trips.</br>
</p>
<p>
I know.</br>
</p>
<p>
Let me ask you something?</br>
</p>
<p>
What about her family? Right?</br>
</p>
<p>
I mean, they all got</br>Swiss passports, fight</br>
</p>
<p>
She's got parents,</br>she's got a brother, right?</br>
</p>
<p>
The brother's got a wife.</br>That's five fucking people.</br>
</p>
<p>
Six, seven trips, boom, right?</br>
</p>
<p>
They're all fucking</br>Swiss nitwits like her.</br>
</p>
<p>
- They'll do it.</br>- We could do that.</br>
</p>
<p>
At least I have a family,</br>you crooked-nose fuck!</br>
</p>
<p>
Hey, uh, don't forget</br>about my money.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm sorry, what's that?</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, I forgot to tell you.</br>He's got some...</br>
</p>

</p>
<p>
You give me a call?</br>

<p>
When it gets here, I'll give you a</br>call and you'll come pick it up.</br>
</p>
<p>
Well, we don't fucking</br>work for you, man!</br>
</p>
<p>
Sweetheart,</br>
</p>
<p>
you have my money</br>taped to your tits.</br>
</p>
<p>
Okay? Technically,</br>you do work for me.</br>

<p>
Hey, Jordan,</br>we're gonna need to talk.</br>

<p>
If I fucking do this,</br>I'm telling you right now,</br>

<p>
I ain't going to him, okay.</br>
</p>
<p>
- I'm not a fucking <i>shvartze.</i></br>- I got it.</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't do fucking</br>pickups, all right?</br>
</p>
<p>
- I got it.</br>- Well, listen to me.</br>

And you tell that</br>fucking piece of shit,</br>
</p>
<p>
- he comes correct.</br>- I will.</br>
</p>
<p>
He comes in all fucking loopy</br>and fucked up, I swear to God</br>
</p>
<p>
I'll mash that</br>douchebag's teeth in.</br>
</p>
<p>
You're gonna mash</br>whose fucking teeth in?</br>
</p>
<p>
Whose fucking teeth</br>are you gonna mash in?</br>
</p>
<p>
I put the money on that</br>fucking table! Not you!</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm the reason</br>we have this whole fucking deal!</br>
</p>
<p>
- He's got a gun, you fucking idiot!</br>- Fuck his gun!</br>
</p>
<p>
I put that money in there!</br>
</p>
<p>
You know what?</br>You're a fucking pill dealer.</br>
</p>
<p>
I got five more just like you, bro.</br>
</p>
<p>
Keep talking,</br>you fucking piece of shit!</br>

</p>
<p>
Go fuck yourself! Give me the bag.</br>

You gotta take this case,</br>

<p>
Don't leave one dollar</br>inside the briefcase.</br>

And once you have it all</br>
</p>
<p>
neatly organized</br>outside the briefcase,</br>
</p>
<p>
I need you to take it</br>and I need you to shove it right up</br>

<p>
Jordan, do I have a</br>surprise for you!</br>
</p>
<p>
What's that?</br>
</p>
<p>
Twenty real Lemmons.</br>
</p>
<p>
Retired pharmacist's</br>client of mine,</br>
</p>
<p>
they've been in the</br>safe for 15 years.</br>
</p>
<p>
Are you fucking kidding me?</br>Lemmons?</br>
</p>
<p>
Ha-ha!</br>
</p>
<p>
They're gonna knock us</br>on our fucking heads.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>When it comes to Quaaludes,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>the Lemmon 714 was the Holy Grail.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
- Can you believe it?</br>- Oh, my God.</br>
</p>
<p>
I thought they were like a myth.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Three times as powerful</br>as anything available today.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Look at these babies.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Boy, Donnie really knew</br>how to celebrate.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>He said he was saving these</br>for a special occasion.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Like a birthday, or</br>being clap free,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>or our money arriving safely</br>in Switzerland.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>So that night,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I cleared my schedule</br>and I rid my body</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>of anything that</br>could fuck with my high.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>It was celebration time.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Okay.</br>
</p>
<p>
Start off with one,</br>see how it goes?</br>
</p>
<p>
My guy says all we'll need is one.</br>
</p>
<p>
Here you go.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Salud!</br>- Cheers.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Maybe if I pull it</br>again, it'll go down.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Steve! Steve!</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I gotta get out of here!</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Carl, I think I got it figured out.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>It must be one pull for up</br>and two pulls for down.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Okay.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Do you feel anything?</br>
</p>
<p>
No.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's been 35 minutes.</br>
</p>
<p>
Hmm.</br>
</p>
<p>
Maybe we've built up a tolerance</br>
</p>
<p>
after all these years, huh?</br>
</p>
<p>
Hmm.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>This is bullshit!</i></br>
</p>
<p>
My metabolism's pumping.</br>I can't feel shit!</br>

Let's take, uh...</br>

<p>
Let's take two more each.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Jordan.</br>- Yeah, baby.</br>
</p>
<p>
What are you two retards doing?</br>
</p>
<p>
We're working out, honey.</br>
</p>
<p>
Well, Bo Dietl's on the phone.</br>
</p>
<p>
Okay.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Okay?</br>- Okay</br>
</p>
<p>
Hey, Bo, what's going on?</br>
</p>
<p>
Jordan, listen to me clearly.</br>
</p>
<p>
I cannot talk to you on this phone,</br>
</p>
<p>
I have to talk to you.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Get out of here.</br>What's going on?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Listen to me!</br>Leave the fucking house, Jordan,</br>
</p>
<p>
and then call me from a pay phone.</br>
</p>
<p>
This is not a fucking joke, Jordan.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Shit.</br>- What'd he say?</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't know what the</br>fuck's going on.</br>
</p>
<p>
- I gotta go!</br>- Is everything okay, Jordan?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>The closest pay</br>phone I could get to</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>was at the Brookville Country Club.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>It was a real WASP stronghold,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>just a mile down the road</br>from my house.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Hey, Bo, what's up, it's me.</br>What's going on?</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm at a pay phone.</br>What's going on?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Listen to me carefully.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Please. Your little</br>friend there, Brad,</br>
</p>
<p>
your little buddy, he's in jail.</br>
</p>
<p>
What the fuck's he in jail for?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>- What'd he do?</br>- I don't know what he did.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
My friends in Long Island told me</br>
</p>
<p>
he got picked up</br>in some fucking shopping mall.</br>
</p>
<p>
He got locked up by...</br>
</p>
<p>
Wait, wait. Did you...</br>Did you say a shopping mall?</br>
</p>
<p>
- Yeah.</br>- He was with Donnie.</br>
</p>
<p>
He was supposed</br>to deliver some money,</br>
</p>
<p>
- then that fucking fat piece of shit...</br><i>- Listen to me!</i></br>
</p>
<p>
I gotta go fucking</br>talk to him right now!</br>
</p>
<p>
Listen to me! Don't go!</br>Listen to me.</br>
</p>
<p>
That guy Denham,</br>that FBI agent guy,</br>
</p>
<p>
somebody told me he's got</br>your phones tapped.</br>
</p>
<p>
Your office and your home.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Don't talk on the</br>motherfucking phone!</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Okay. Fuck! I got it.</br>I got it. I got it.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Jordan.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
You didn't try to bribe this</br>fucking FBI agent, did you?</br>
</p>
<p>
No, I didn't try to</br>bribe an FBI agent.</br>
</p>
<p>
You think I'm that fucking stupid?</br>No.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>What the fuck did you say?</br>I can't understand you.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Say that again.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
I said...</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>What the fuck are you saying?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
I said...</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Are you fucking high?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Jordan, are you fucking high?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Jordan, do me a favor,</br>stay where you are.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Don't get behind the</br>wheel of the car.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I'm gonna send Rocco over</br>to pick you up.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Jordan! Jordan!</i></br>

<p>
<i>After 15 years in storage,</i></br>

</p>
<p>
<i>Pow!</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I mean, I had skipped</br>the tingle phase</i></br>

You fucking cocksucker!</br>
</p>

What did you do,</br>
</p>
<p>
you piece of shit?</br>
</p>
<p>
Fuck you!</br>
</p>
<p>
I wanna fucking kill you!</br>
</p>
<p>
I wanna fucking kill you!</br>
</p>
<p>
I got you!</br>
</p>
<p>
What the fuck happened?</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, shit!</br>
</p>
<p>
Jordan? Jordan, are you all right?</br>
</p>
<p>
Donnie? Donnie?</br>
</p>
<p>
Donnie?</br>
</p>
<p>
Jordan, he's not breathing.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, fuck, I don't know what to do.</br>
</p>
<p>
Jordan, I don't know</br>what the fuck to do!</br>
</p>
<p>
I can't help him!</br>Oh, my God. Jordan.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, my God, I think he's choking,</br>Jordan. Do something.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Oh, God.</br>- Baby, I got you!</br>
</p>
<p>
He's not breathing, Jordan.</br>You gotta do something!</br>
</p>
<p>
Shit! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Ah!</i></br>
</p>
<p>
I got you.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh!</br>
</p>
<p>
Step aside!</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, God!</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, God!</br>
</p>
<p>
Move aside, baby.</br>
</p>
<p>
Come on! Come on!</br>
</p>
<p>
Come on!</br>
</p>
<p>
Jordan, he's not breathing.</br>You gotta do something.</br>
</p>
<p>
Jordan, he's a father!</br>He's got fucking kids!</br>
</p>
<p>
- Do something!</br>- Yeah?</br>
</p>
<p>
Rocco, you gotta get over here.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Come on.</br>- Call an ambulance!</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't fucking know!</br>
</p>
<p>
Just get over here! Call 911.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
You all right? He's all right.</br>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Belfort?</br>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Belfort?</br>
</p>
<p>
- Get the fuck out of here.</br>- Fuck.</br>
</p>
<p>
Sir, we need to ask</br>you some questions.</br>
</p>
<p>
Are you fucking kidding me?</br>Fuck you.</br>
</p>
<p>
Come on, get up.</br>
</p>
<p>
Get the fuck out of my house.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Let's go.</br>- I've been here all night.</br>
</p>
<p>
I been sitting here all night.</br>
</p>
<p>
What the fuck are</br>you talking about?</br>
</p>
<p>
- Where you taking him?</br>- Where you taking me?</br>
</p>
<p>
Where you taking him?</br>
</p>
<p>
You ain't got no warrant.</br>
</p>
<p>
Just come up in people's</br>house like that!</br>
</p>
<p>
Did you drive your car tonight,</br>Mr. Belfort?</br>
</p>
<p>
Huh?</br>
</p>
<p>
Well?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Wow!</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Maybe I hadn't made it home okay.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Get out of the fucking way!</br>
</p>
<p>
Fuck!</br>
</p>
<p>
Did you drive</br>
</p>
<p>
that car tonight?</br>
</p>
<p>
- Yeah.</br>- Yeah, right.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm a family man!</br>
</p>
<p>
Family man. Honey!</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>It was a miracle I wasn't killed,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>or that I didn't kill anybody else.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>The cops took me in</br>for questioning,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>but they couldn't charge me.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>They had no proof</br>I was even behind the wheel.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Meanwhile,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Brad did three months</br>in jail for contempt</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>because he wouldn't rat Donnie out.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>The result,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I was soot-free.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>But I had eyes on me</br>like never before.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
You're a lucky man, Jordan.</br>
</p>
<p>
You're lucky to be alive,</br>let alone not in jail.</br>
</p>
<p>
You know I don't believe</br>in luck, right?</br>
</p>
<p>
But it's time.</br>
</p>
<p>
Please, let me call the SEC</br>and cut a deal</br>
</p>
<p>
before your luck runs out.</br>
</p>
<p>
Wave to Daddy.</br>
</p>
<p>
Hey.</br>
</p>
<p>
Hey, sweetie.</br>
</p>
<p>
What kind of terms would you</br>be talking about if I...</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't know.</br>
</p>
<p>
You plead guilty to a handful</br>of securities violations,</br>
</p>
<p>
stock manipulation,</br>high-pressure sales tactics.</br>
</p>
<p>
Ticky-tack shit like</br>that, you know.</br>
</p>
<p>
You pay a couple million</br>dollars in fines,</br>
</p>
<p>
in exchange, the SEC fucks</br>off till the end of time.</br>
</p>
<p>
And Stratton?</br>
</p>
<p>
What happens to Stratton?</br>
</p>
<p>
There's no way... I mean...</br>You got to walk away. Right?</br>
</p>
<p>
Let Donnie be in charge.</br>
</p>
<p>
Right. Donnie.</br>
</p>
<p>
Now the FBI is</br>another animal completely.</br>
</p>
<p>
They'll still be pursuing you</br>for criminal wrongdoing.</br>
</p>
<p>
However, with you stepping</br>down voluntarily,</br>
</p>
<p>
my guess is that</br>your best friend Agent Denham</br>
</p>
<p>
will be standing around</br>with his dick in his hand.</br>
</p>
<p>
Jordan.</br>
</p>
<p>
What do you have to think about?</br>
</p>
<p>
You beat them.</br>
</p>
<p>
You won!</br>
</p>
<p>
God knows you never</br>have to work again.</br>
</p>
<p>
What're you gonna do?</br>Spend the rest of your life in jail?</br>
</p>
<p>
- Is that what you want?</br>- No.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Of course not.</br>- Okay.</br>
</p>
<p>
Okay! You got all the</br>money in the world.</br>
</p>
<p>
You need everybody else's money?</br>
</p>
<p>
- Of course not, Pops.</br>- Well?</br>
</p>
<p>
- You know, I built it.</br>- I know you built it.</br>
</p>
<p>
You built it, so now preserve it.</br>
</p>
<p>
You know,</br>
</p>
<p>
five years ago, when I</br>started Stratton Oakmont</br>
</p>
<p>
with Donnie Azoff, I knew the day</br>
</p>
<p>
would eventually come</br>where I'd have to be moving on.</br>
</p>
<p>
And it's truly with a heavy heart</br>
</p>
<p>
that I'm here to say that...</br>
</p>
<p>
That that day is finally here.</br>
</p>
<p>
I wanna...</br>I want to thank you all for your...</br>
</p>
<p>
Your years of loyalty</br>and admiration.</br>
</p>
<p>
But the point is this.</br>
</p>
<p>
Under Donnie's leadership,</br>
</p>
<p>
along with Nicky Koskoff</br>and Robbie Feinberg</br>
</p>
<p>
moving into key management</br>positions, this place really</br>
</p>
<p>
is gonna be better than ever!</br>
</p>
<p>
That I promise you. Okay?</br>
</p>
<p>
Give them a round of applause.</br>Come on.</br>
</p>
<p>
This is Ellis Island here, people.</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't care who you are,</br>where you're from,</br>
</p>
<p>
whether your relatives came</br>over on the fucking Mayflower</br>
</p>
<p>
or on an inner tube from Haiti,</br>
</p>
<p>
this right here is the</br>land of opportunity.</br>
</p>
<p>
Stratton Oakmont is America!</br>
</p>
<p>
All of you know</br>Kimmie Belzer, right?</br>
</p>
<p>
Yes, we do.</br>
</p>
<p>
Fuck you.</br>
</p>
<p>
Come on, Kimmie.</br>
</p>
<p>
What you probably didn't know is,</br>
</p>
<p>
Kimmie was one of</br>the first brokers here,</br>
</p>
<p>
one of Stratton's original 20.</br>
</p>
<p>
Now most of you met Kimmie,</br>
</p>
<p>
the beautiful sophisticated woman</br>that she is today.</br>
</p>
<p>
A woman that wears</br>$3,000 Armani suits.</br>
</p>
<p>
Who drives a brand-new</br>Mercedes-Benz.</br>
</p>
<p>
A woman who spends</br>
</p>
<p>
her winters in the Bahamas</br>
</p>
<p>
and summers in the Hamptons!</br>
</p>
<p>
That's not the Kimmie that I met.</br>
</p>
<p>
The Kimmie that I met didn't have</br>two nickels to rub together.</br>
</p>
<p>
She was a single mom</br>on the balls of her ass</br>
</p>
<p>
with an 8-year-old son.</br>
</p>
<p>
Okay? She was</br>three months behind on her rent.</br>
</p>
<p>
And when she came to me</br>and asked me for a job,</br>
</p>
<p>
she asked for a $5,000 advance</br>
</p>
<p>
just so she could pay</br>her son's tuition.</br>
</p>
<p>
And what'd I do, Kimmie?</br>
</p>
<p>
Go on, tell them.</br>
</p>
<p>
You wrote me a check</br>
</p>
<p>
for $25,000.</br>
</p>
<p>
That's right.</br>
</p>
<p>
Thank you.</br>
</p>
<p>
And you know why that is?</br>
</p>
<p>
It's because I believed in you.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's because I believed</br>in you, Kimmie,</br>
</p>
<p>
just like I believe in each</br>
</p>
<p>
and every one of you here today.</br>
</p>
<p>
- I fucking love you, Jordan!</br>- I fucking love you.</br>
</p>
<p>
I fucking love you! I love you.</br>
</p>
<p>
I fucking love you, too!</br>I fucking love you, too!</br>
</p>
<p>
And I love all of you!</br>
</p>
<p>
And I love all of you</br>from the bottom of my heart.</br>
</p>
<p>
- I fucking love you, too.</br>- I mean that.</br>
</p>
<p>
You are the shit.</br>You are the fucking shit.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's a shame, you know.</br>
</p>
<p>
For years, I've been</br>telling you guys</br>
</p>
<p>
never to take no for</br>an answer, right?</br>
</p>
<p>
You know, to keep pushing,</br>to never hang up the phone</br>
</p>
<p>
until you get what you want.</br>
</p>
<p>
Because you all deserve it.</br>
</p>
<p>
You know, this fucking deal</br>that I'm about to sign</br>
</p>
<p>
barring me from the</br>securities industry,</br>
</p>
<p>
barring me from Stratton,</br>
</p>
<p>
my home.</br>
</p>
<p>
What the fuck is that, you know?</br>
</p>
<p>
I'll tell you what it is. It's...</br>
</p>
<p>
It's me taking no for an answer,</br>you know.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's them...</br>
</p>
<p>
It's them selling me,</br>not the other way around.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's me being a hypocrite</br>is what it is.</br>
</p>
<p>
So...</br>
</p>
<p>
You know what?</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm not leaving.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm not leaving.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm not fucking leaving!</br>
</p>
<p>
You're not getting</br>a fucking promotion!</br>
</p>
<p>
The show goes on!</br>
</p>
<p>
This is my home!</br>
</p>
<p>
They're gonna need</br>a fucking wrecking ball</br>
</p>
<p>
to take me out of here!</br>
</p>
<p>
They're gonna need to</br>send in the National Guard</br>
</p>
<p>
or fucking SWAT team</br>
</p>
<p>
'cause I ain't going nowhere!</br>
</p>
<p>
Fuck them!</br>
</p>
<p>
Fuck them!</br>
</p>
<p>
Jordy! Jordy!</br>
</p>
<p>
Jordy! Get back here!</br>
</p>
<p>
Hey!</br>
</p>
<p>
Give me that.</br>
</p>
<p>
What is this?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Ramar of the Jungle,</br>for Christ sake?</i></br>

<i>Jordan Belfort just welched</br>on his deal with the SEC.</i></br>

<p>
<i>He is back in the ocean.</br>Happy hunting.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>It was our time to party big.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>And just as Brad</br>was released from jail, too.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I apologized, even</br>offered to pay him</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>for his time in the can.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>But he said no, that he was out.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>He didn't want any part of us.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Sad thing was,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>two years later</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>he was dead.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Massive heart attack. Thirty-five.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Same age Mozart died.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Not that they have a hell</br>of a lot in common, but...</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Anyway, I don't know</br>why that came to mind.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Within days,</i></br>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<i>Notices to produce documents,</br>depositions, you name it.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Donnie couldn't drink</br>water fast enough.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
United States government</br>wants to give me a subpoena?</br>
</p>
<p>
Here's what we do with</br>subpoenas at Stratton Oakmont!</br>
</p>
<p>
Fuck you, USA! Fuck you!</br>
</p>
<p>
Fuck you! Fuck you!</br>
</p>
<p>
Fuck you!</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh!</br>
</p>
<p>
Jordan Belfort.</br>
</p>
<p>
Alden. That's a nice name.</br>
</p>
<p>
Thank you very much for that.</br>
</p>
<p>
- What kind of name is that?</br>- That is my name.</br>
</p>
<p>
I do not recall that.</br>
</p>
<p>
I do not recall that. Okay?</br>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Ming,</br>thank you for coming in today.</br>
</p>
<p>
Are you gonna finish</br>the rest of that Danish?</br>
</p>
<p>
- Can I have that Danish?</br>- No, no, go ahead.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>They interrogated everybody.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
I got a low blood sugar,</br>thyroid thing.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>It went on for months.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>It was a total fucking harassment.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Tell him to proceed</br>with the questions.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>But not a single</br>Strattonite cracked.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Gladys Carrera?</br>
</p>
<p>
Doesn't ring a bell.</br>
</p>
<p>
Sorry, I have no</br>recommendation of that.</br>
</p>
<p>
No.</br>
</p>
<p>
No idea.</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't recall that transaction.</br>You guys have any milk?</br>
</p>
<p>
Absolutely not.</br>
</p>
<p>
Francis Sortigi</br>you called so many times</br>
</p>
<p>
I just thought you</br>might remember that.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Would you remember any of those?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
- I do not recall any of that.</br>- This Abdul...</br>
</p>
<p>
I do not... No, I don't recall.</br>
</p>
<p>
It was a long phone call.</br>
</p>
<p>
I just wondered</br>if you have any memory of that.</br>
</p>
<p>
Okay. You know we've</br>talked to several</br>
</p>
<p>
of the employees at this firm</br>
</p>
<p>
and nobody can recall anything</br>
</p>
<p>
about this Steve Madden IPO.</br>
</p>
<p>
I think it's Odd.</br>
</p>
<p>
Do you recall</br>
</p>
<p>
Cartage Corporation?</br>
</p>
<p>
Mmm.</br>
</p>
<p>
You do recall it?</br>
</p>
<p>
No, I don't recall that at all.</br>
</p>
<p>
Excuse me. I have to ask.</br>Is that your real hair?</br>
</p>
<p>
Are you gonna say</br>anything about that?</br>
</p>
<p>
Are you gonna comment on my hair?</br>
</p>
<p>
Is that how we're doing...</br>Is this personal questions?</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm just wondering why you would</br>wear something like that.</br>
</p>
<p>
Sorry. I don't recall that company.</br>
</p>
<p>
Can I get you anything</br>else, gentlemen?</br>
</p>
<p>
Yes. Sweetheart,</br>I have a rare condition</br>
</p>
<p>
which requires me to</br>drink one of those</br>

<p>
Jordan, look.</br>I'm watching the screen</br>
</p>
<p>
and huge chunks of Steve Madden</br>are being sold, okay.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's not coming from us,</br>so it's gotta be Steve.</br>
</p>
<p>
He's the only person</br>with that many shares.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's Donnie.</br>Call me back, all right.</br>
</p>

What's going on? Why you crying?</br>
</p>
<p>
- She's dead!</br>- Who? Who's dead?</br>
</p>
<p>
I just got a call</br>from my cousin Betty.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah?</br>
</p>
<p>
Aunt Emma is dead.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Are you fucking kidding me?</br>- No.</br>
</p>
<p>
You're serious?</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, my God! Baby, that's...</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, fuck!</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, sweetheart, that's just...</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Fucking heart attack!</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Boom, snap, gone.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Shuffled off her mortal coil.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>And $20 million stuck</br>in a Swiss bank account.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
The last time I talked to her</br>she was fine!</br>
</p>
<p>
- She's not that old.</br>- Oh, God! Baby, oh, God!</br>
</p>
<p>
That's so fucking terrible!</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, fuck!</br>
</p>
<p>
It is terrible.</br>
</p>
<p>
Your aunt was such an elegant,</br>attractive woman.</br>
</p>
<p>
My condolences to you</br>and your family.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yes. We're absolutely devastated.</br>
</p>
<p>
Thank you so much</br>for your condolences.</br>
</p>
<p>
Now where does that leave us</br>
</p>
<p>
in regard to her account exactly?</br>
</p>
<p>
Does it go into probate or what?</br>
</p>
<p>
Not to worry, Jordan. Not to worry.</br>
</p>
<p>
Your aunt, before she died,</br>
</p>
<p>
signed a document naming you</br>as her successor.</br>
</p>
<p>
She did?</br>
</p>
<p>
Fantastic! Well, that's good news!</br>
</p>
<p>
Well, not as of yet.</br>
</p>
<p>
What does that mean? Not as of yet?</br>
</p>
<p>
I can't seem to hear you.</br>
</p>
<p>
I must have bad reception.</br>Are you speaking English?</br>
</p>
<p>
- Very... Now. Fast. Very fast.</br><i>- Fast?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
I have to get to Switzerland now?</br>
</p>
<p>
Speak English!</br>Fucking speak English!</br>
</p>
<p>
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey.</br>Hey! Quiet, okay?</br>
</p>
<p>
Take your suit,</br>take your dick, okay,</br>
</p>
<p>
- and move your ass! Please.</br>- Okay.</br>
</p>
<p>
Move my ass! Yes!</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I gotta say, these Swiss were</br>some sneaky motherfuckers.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Within minutes,</br>he had me set up with a forger</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>who could fake Aunt</br>Emma's signature.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
You American shit!</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I just had to get</br>there by tomorrow,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>or lose $20 million.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
We're going to Monaco!</br>
</p>
<p>
- Monaco? Now?</br>- Yes, baby.</br>
</p>
<p>
We're going to Monaco, so then</br>we can go to Switzerland, okay?</br>
</p>
<p>
- But her aunt just died.</br>- I realize that.</br>
</p>
<p>
But I have business in Switzerland.</br>
</p>
<p>
I need to go to</br>Switzerland right now.</br>
</p>
<p>
Bottom line. Sorry.</br>
</p>
<p>
We gotta get to London.</br>
</p>
<p>
Why? Why?</br>
</p>
<p>
The funeral!</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, but babe. Look, look...</br>
</p>
<p>
I loved your aunt more than</br>anyone in the entire world.</br>
</p>
<p>
I really did.</br>
</p>
<p>
But she's dead now, sweetie.</br>
</p>
<p>
She's dead</br>and she's not going anywhere.</br>
</p>
<p>
She'll still be dead by the time</br>
</p>
<p>
we get to London, okay?</br>
</p>
<p>
Captain Ted! Captain</br>Ted, all right, look.</br>
</p>
<p>
We're going to Monaco.</br>Monaco now, okay?</br>
</p>
<p>
Monaco, right.</br>
</p>
<p>
We're going to Monaco</br>so that we can drive to Switzerland</br>
</p>
<p>
so they don't stamp our passports.</br>
</p>
<p>
Take care of business here,</br>we'll drive back to Monaco,</br>
</p>
<p>
take a flight over to London</br>to catch the funeral</br>
</p>
<p>
and be in New York</br>in three fucking business days!</br>
</p>
<p>
That's the fucking plan.</br>
</p>
<p>
I just want you to know</br>that we might run into some chop.</br>
</p>
<p>
Chop?</br>We can fucking handle chop, right?</br>
</p>
<p>
I mean, it's a 170-foot yacht.</br>
</p>
<p>
No, no, no. We're</br>not going anywhere</br>
</p>
<p>
unless he says it's</br>safe, all right.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Don't worry about the chop.</br>- It's safe.</br>
</p>
<p>
You don't know shit about chop.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, really? And you do?</br>You're a fucking expert on that.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'll chop your fucking credit</br>card in half. How about that?</br>
</p>
<p>
Chop is fine. Trust me.</br>Chop is fine.</br>
</p>
<p>
Is chop fine, Captain Ted?</br>
</p>
<p>
Uh...</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah. I mean, if we take it slow.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, we're gonna take it slow.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's a little uncomfortable.</br>Tell them it's safe.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's gonna be safe.</br>
</p>
<p>
We'll batten down the hatches</br>
</p>
<p>
and secure the deck.</br>
</p>
<p>
And we're looking at a few...</br>Maybe a few broken dishes.</br>
</p>
<p>
Few broken dishes.</br>
</p>
<p>
What's a few broken dishes?</br>
</p>
<p>
Does that sound fucking</br>awesome or what?</br>
</p>
<p>
No. Not really.</br>
</p>
<p>
We're gonna have a</br>fucking good time!</br>
</p>
<p>
Let's go to fucking Monaco now!</br>
</p>
<p>
Let's fucking move! Let's go!</br>
</p>
<p>
Hold On!</br>
</p>
<p>
What the fuck is going on out here?</br>
</p>
<p>
The Jet Skis just went overboard!</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, Jesus Christ! Honey, you okay?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Gale warning! Gale warning!</i></br>
</p>
<p>
The waves are</br>20 feet high and building!</br>
</p>
<p>
Turn around, let's go</br>the other fucking way.</br>
</p>
<p>
- We can't!</br>- Go!</br>
</p>
<p>
We'll get broad-sided.</br>It'll tip over!</br>
</p>
<p>
I am a master diver. You hear that?</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm a master diver!</br>
</p>
<p>
No one's gonna fucking die!</br>
</p>
<p>
I got you, baby. I got you.</br>Trust me, okay?</br>
</p>
<p>
I love you.</br>
</p>
<p>
I love you, baby.</br>Just hold on tight.</br>

Okay.</br>

I don't wanna die, Jordan!</br>
</p>
<p>
I did a lot of bad shit.</br>I'm going to hell, Jordan!</br>
</p>
<p>
I fucked up! I fucked up so bad!</br>

<p>
I can't go down there, Jordan.</br>It's flooded.</br>

It's three feet of</br>water down there!</br>
</p>
<p>
I will not die sober!</br>
</p>
<p>
Get those fucking ludes!</br>
</p>
<p>
Okay!</br>

He's just warning everybody!</br>

Mayday!</br>

<p>
This is Captain Ted Beecham</br>aboard the yacht Naomi!</br>

We require immediate assistance!</br>

Watch out!</br>

<p>
<i>The nice thing about</br>getting rescued by Italians</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>is that they feed you,</br>make you drink red wine,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>then you get to dance.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Did you see that?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>That was the plane</br>I sent to come get us.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I shit you not, it exploded</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>when a seagull flew</br>into the engine.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Three people killed.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>You want a sign from God?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Well, after all this,</br>I finally got the message.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Do you dream of becoming</br>financially independent</i></br>
</p>
<p>
but struggle every month</br>just to pay your bills?</br>
</p>
<p>
Would you like to own</br>a home like this,</br>
</p>
<p>
but can barely afford</br>to pay your rent?</br>
</p>
<p>
My name is Jordan Belfort,</br>
</p>
<p>
and there's no secret</br>to wealth creation.</br>
</p>
<p>
No matter who you are,</br>
</p>
<p>
no matter where you came from,</br>
</p>
<p>
you too can become</br>financially independent</br>
</p>
<p>
in just a matter of months.</br>
</p>
<p>
All you need is a strategy.</br>
</p>
<p>
When I was 24 years old,</br>
</p>
<p>
I made a decision not just</br>to survive, but to thrive.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>At first I didn't feel like</br>deals like these were possible.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
But we have the house</br>and we have a $33,000 profit.</br>
</p>
<p>
I certainly believe now.</br>
</p>
<p>
Think about it for a second.</br>
</p>
<p>
If you don't have the guts</br>to attend Jordan Belfort's</br>
</p>
<p>
Straight Line Persuasion</br>System seminar,</br>
</p>
<p>
then how do you expect</br>to make any money?</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>If you want to be</br>a millionaire someday,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>have some guts. Make a decision.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Jordan Belfort's</br>setup worked for me</br>
</p>
<p>
because I worked hard for it.</br>
</p>
<p>
And if it doesn't work for you,</br>
</p>
<p>
it's because you're lazy.</br>
</p>
<p>
And you should get a</br>job at McDonald's.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>There's nobody holding</br>you back from financial freedom.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
And there's nobody stopping</br>you from making millions.</br>
</p>
<p>
Don't just sit at home,</br>
</p>
<p>
or the life of your dreams</br>will sail right past you.</br>
</p>
<p>
I changed all these people's lives</br>
</p>
<p>
and I can change yours, too!</br>
</p>
<p>
So come to my seminar!</br>
</p>
<p>
The life of your dreams is only...</br>
</p>
<p>
Good to see you again, Jordan.</br>
</p>
<p>
You're under arrest!</br>
</p>
<p>
You gotta be joking!</br>
</p>
<p>
You're kidding me.</br>
</p>
<p>
Hey, get the fuck away from me!</br>
</p>
<p>
Turn that camera off.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm fucking shooting a</br>fucking infomercial here,</br>
</p>
<p>
you fucking cocksucker!</br>
</p>
<p>
- Fuck you, you motherfucker!</br>- Shut the fucking camera off.</br>
</p>
<p>
You don't got shit</br>on me, you hear me!</br>
</p>
<p>
Go fuck yourself!</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm making an honest living,</br>you fucking piece of shit!</br>
</p>
<p>
Hey, Jordan,</br>
</p>
<p>
let me give you a</br>little legal advice.</br>
</p>
<p>
Shut the fuck up!</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, fuck you, you fucking prick!</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm making an honest living,</br>you motherfucker!</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I clean up my act.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I did rehab. I'm a TV personality.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I'm sober for two years.</br>And this happens!</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Rugrat goes and gets busted</br>down in Miami.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
I'm Swiss, I'm not communist.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>And guess who</br>the fuck with? Saurel.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
- You gonna beat me?</br>- No, sir.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, I know your country.</br>You're gonna beat me.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I mean, what are</br>the fucking odds?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>There had to be 10,000</br>Swiss bankers in Geneva,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>and Rugrat gets the</br>one dumb enough</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>to get himself arrested</br>on U. S. soil.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
I know.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm so sorry.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Even more fucked</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>- was that he got busted</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>for shit that had</br>nothing to do with me.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>It had nothing to</br>fucking do with me.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Something about</br>laundering drug money</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>through offshore boat racing</br>and a guy named Rocky Aoki,</i></br>

<p>

<p>
<i>Why would you be so cruel</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>as to choose a chain</br>of fucking hibachi restaurants</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>to take me down?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Long story short.</br>Saurel rats me out.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>But not before he rats out</br>Brad's wife, Chantalle,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>who, it turns out,</br>he'd been fucking</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>every time she went to Switzerland!</i></br>

<p>
Woof. I hate that fucking dog.</br>
</p>

Yeah, he's getting</br>old and decrepit.</br>
</p>
<p>
Starting to shit in</br>the house again.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Me, too.</br>- Come here, buddy.</br>
</p>
<p>
Ah, fuck.</br>
</p>
<p>
- It's good to see you, pal.</br>- Yeah, you, too.</br>
</p>
<p>
Good to see you.</br>

<p>
Sit down. Oh, man.</br>
</p>
<p>
How you doing, brother?</br>
</p>
<p>
You know.</br>
</p>
<p>
Shitty, pal.</br>
</p>
<p>
But I'm hanging in there.</br>
</p>
<p>
My new piece of jewelry.</br>Check that out.</br>
</p>
<p>
Can't leave the house, you know?</br>
</p>
<p>
Starting to get cabin</br>fever already.</br>
</p>
<p>
Fucking Rugrat.</br>
</p>
<p>
That wig-wearing faggot.</br>
</p>
<p>
I can't believe that fucking guy.</br>I wanna kill him.</br>
</p>
<p>
Swear to God,</br>I want to choke him to death.</br>
</p>
<p>
Irresponsible little prick.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'll tell you one thing.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm never eating at Benihana again.</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't care whose birthday it is.</br>
</p>
<p>
Where's Naomi? How's she doing?</br>
</p>
<p>
That's her in the house there.</br>
</p>
<p>
You could say hi, but she</br>probably won't wave back.</br>
</p>
<p>
Naomi, sweetheart!</br>
</p>
<p>
What's up her ass?</br>
</p>
<p>
- Is she mad at me?</br>- No, you know...</br>
</p>
<p>
We probably have to</br>mortgage the house</br>
</p>
<p>
in order to make bail.</br>
</p>
<p>
Probably end up selling the thing</br>
</p>
<p>
in order to pay for</br>all the lawyers.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's been a nightmare, buddy,</br>to tell you the truth.</br>
</p>
<p>
What are you gonna do, right?</br>
</p>
<p>
Anyway, how's Stratton?</br>That's more important.</br>
</p>
<p>
How's morale?</br>
</p>
<p>
They all pissed off 'cause they</br>have to make money legally now?</br>
</p>
<p>
- Jordan.</br>- Hmm?</br>
</p>
<p>
I got the founding</br>partners together.</br>
</p>
<p>
I talked to them about everything.</br>
</p>
<p>
And I got you.</br>
</p>
<p>
What do you mean, you got me?</br>
</p>
<p>
The house, money, don't</br>worry about it. I got you.</br>
</p>
<p>
All right.</br>
</p>
<p>
I love you, buddy.</br>
</p>
<p>
- You know I'd do it for you, right?</br>- I know.</br>
</p>
<p>
- You know that, right?</br>- I know.</br>
</p>
<p>
I could fucking kiss you all over.</br>
</p>
<p>
All right, enough, enough.</br>
</p>
<p>
You want a beer, pal?</br>
</p>
<p>
What are you drinking?</br>
</p>
<p>
I got this non-alcoholic shit.</br>
</p>
<p>
What's that?</br>
</p>
<p>
A non-alcoholic beer.</br>It's got no alcohol.</br>
</p>
<p>
- It's a beer?</br>- Yeah, with no alcohol.</br>
</p>
<p>
But if you drink enough,</br>
</p>
<p>
if you drink a lot,</br>they get you fucked up?</br>
</p>
<p>
No, there's no alcohol.</br>That's the fucking point.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm not a scientist.</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't know what the fuck</br>you're talking about.</br>
</p>
<p>
I can get you a beer</br>if you want a fucking beer.</br>
</p>
<p>
I know, but I don't drink.</br>You remember?</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't drink anymore.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, you wanna go inside</br>
</p>
<p>
and blow some lines</br>of baking powder?</br>
</p>
<p>
Or baking soda...</br>
</p>
<p>
Can't imagine ever not</br>enjoying getting fucked up.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Yeah.</br>- I love it.</br>
</p>
<p>
How's being sober?</br>
</p>
<p>
- Fucking sucks.</br>- Boring, right?</br>
</p>
<p>
So boring. I wanna kill myself.</br>
</p>
<p>
There's a term,</br>and we don't like to use it</br>
</p>
<p>
unless circumstances dictate,</br>
</p>
<p>
and I think they do</br>dictate in this case,</br>
</p>
<p>
and the term is "Grenada."</br>
</p>
<p>
Have you ever heard of Grenada?</br>
</p>
<p>
No. No, I haven't.</br>
</p>
<p>
Grenada's very interesting because</br>
</p>
<p>
it is a small island nation</br>
</p>
<p>
that was invaded by the United</br>States of America in 1983.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's about 90,000 people.</br>
</p>
<p>
And essentially, it means</br>
</p>
<p>
this case is unloseable.</br>
</p>
<p>
Okay?</br>
</p>
<p>
So, you know, we can come in,</br>
</p>
<p>
we can have our dick</br>hanging out of our pants.</br>
</p>
<p>
Nobody gives a fuck.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm gonna win.</br>
</p>
<p>
You, sir.</br>
</p>
<p>
Are what's known</br>
</p>
<p>
as a Grenada.</br>
</p>
<p>
Hmm.</br>
</p>
<p>
You're looking at real prison time.</br>
</p>
<p>
Hmm.</br>
</p>
<p>
Money laundering can get you</br>as much as 20 years.</br>
</p>
<p>
And our case couldn't be stronger</br>if we caught you</br>
</p>
<p>
shoving cash in your mattress.</br>
</p>
<p>
Is that right?</br>
</p>
<p>
Hey, Jordan. Jordan.</br>
</p>
<p>
Your rotting away in jail</br>till your kids get out of college,</br>
</p>
<p>
that's not our ambition here.</br>
</p>
<p>
There's other people</br>involved in this, too.</br>
</p>
<p>
We think they need to</br>see their day in court as well.</br>
</p>
<p>
Why do I sense</br>there's an offer in the air?</br>
</p>
<p>
Look at him. He's got a sense.</br>What are you, Kreskin?</br>
</p>
<p>
Full cooperation. He provides</br>us with a comprehensive list</br>
</p>
<p>
of all the co-conspirators</br>spanning the last seven years,</br>
</p>
<p>
and he also agrees to wear a wire.</br>
</p>
<p>
Wait...</br>
</p>
<p>
Did you just say "wear a wire"?</br>
</p>
<p>
A wire. Mmm-hmm.</br>
</p>
<p>
What does that mean?</br>
</p>
<p>
You want me to rat? Is that it?</br>
</p>
<p>
No, I want you to cooperate.</br>
</p>
<p>
- No. You want me to rat, right?</br>- Yes. We want you to rat.</br>
</p>
<p>
That's fucking exactly</br>what we want you to do. To rat.</br>
</p>
<p>
How was Cristy's party?</br>
</p>
<p>
Fine.</br>
</p>
<p>
Good.</br>
</p>
<p>
Babe, I spoke to the</br>lawyers again today.</br>
</p>
<p>
I have some really,</br>really great news.</br>
</p>
<p>
Mmm-hmm.</br>
</p>
<p>
Turns out you're completely</br>off the hook, honey.</br>
</p>
<p>
I know that already.</br>
</p>
<p>
Right. Exactly.</br>
</p>
<p>
You never did anything wrong</br>in the first place, right?</br>
</p>
<p>
It turns out, all the FBI really</br>
</p>
<p>
wants from me is to, uh,</br>
</p>
<p>
to cooperate.</br>
</p>
<p>
You know?</br>
</p>
<p>
Turns out I have so</br>much information</br>
</p>
<p>
about the stock market</br>and Wall Street,</br>
</p>
<p>
I could save the government</br>
</p>
<p>
years of heartache, not to mention</br>
</p>
<p>
- countless dollars.</br>- Mmm-hmm.</br>
</p>
<p>
But it gets even better, babe.</br>
</p>
<p>
Because if I do</br>decide to cooperate,</br>
</p>
<p>
I might only be</br>looking at four short years,</br>
</p>
<p>
in which case, you know,</br>
</p>
<p>
we could start fresh,</br>maybe sell the house.</br>
</p>
<p>
And any fines that I'd have to pay</br>
</p>
<p>
wouldn't be due till</br>after I serve my term,</br>
</p>
<p>
so we'd still have plenty of</br>money left over, you know?</br>
</p>
<p>
Mmm-hmm.</br>
</p>
<p>
The only thing that of course</br>bummed me out a little bit</br>
</p>
<p>
is this whole idea of having to</br>
</p>
<p>
give information about my friends.</br>
</p>
<p>
Like you said, "There's no friends</br>on Wall Street." Right?</br>
</p>
<p>
Right. Right. Exactly.</br>
</p>
<p>
There's a silver lining</br>to that, too, honey.</br>
</p>
<p>
Because they said eventually...</br>
</p>
<p>
Eventually everyone's gonna have to</br>give information on this case.</br>
</p>
<p>
So, at the end of the day, it might</br>not even be a factor. You know?</br>
</p>
<p>
Well, that's good news. Right?</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm really happy for you.</br>
</p>
<p>
What do you mean, happy for me,</br>sweetheart?</br>
</p>
<p>
You should be happy for</br>the both of us. Right?</br>
</p>
<p>
- Yeah, right.</br>- All right.</br>
</p>
<p>
Come here, baby.</br>
</p>
<p>
Give me a kiss, sweetheart.</br>
</p>
<p>
Jordan...</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, come on, baby.</br>
</p>
<p>
I haven't made love to</br>you in so long. Please.</br>
</p>
<p>
- No. Jordan, stop it.</br>- Come on, honey, please.</br>
</p>
<p>
No! Jordan, stop it!</br>
</p>
<p>
I've loved you</br>since the moment I saw you.</br>
</p>
<p>
I fucking hate you, Jordan.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Get off me!</br>- Baby... Don't do that.</br>
</p>
<p>
You know how much I</br>love you, right?</br>
</p>
<p>
Stop that, sweetie. Please.</br>
</p>
<p>
You wanna fuck me, Jordan?</br>
</p>
<p>
You wanna fuck me?</br>
</p>
<p>
Good.</br>
</p>
<p>
Go ahead.</br>
</p>
<p>
Go ahead and fuck me.</br>
</p>
<p>
I want you to fuck me real hard.</br>
</p>
<p>
I want you to fuck me</br>like it's the last fucking time.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Why are you moving like that?</br>- Come on.</br>
</p>
<p>
Please hold still.</br>
</p>
<p>
'Cause I want you to</br>come for me, baby.</br>
</p>
<p>
Come on, babe.</br>
</p>
<p>
Come for me, baby.</br>
</p>
<p>
I want you to come for me</br>
</p>
<p>
like it's the last fucking time.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Yeah?</br>- Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
Come on, baby. Come for me.</br>Come for me, baby.</br>
</p>
<p>
Come on, baby.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Yeah?</br>- Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Yeah, baby, come.</br>- You want me to come for you?</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
- You want me to come for you?</br>- Yeah!</br>
</p>
<p>
Huh? You want me to come for you?</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, God, baby. Yeah!</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, God. Oh, God.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, God.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, God.</br>
</p>
<p>
Jesus.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, baby.</br>
</p>
<p>
That was so fucking great!</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, God!</br>
</p>
<p>
That was the last time.</br>
</p>
<p>
What do you mean, baby?</br>
</p>
<p>
I mean that was the last time</br>we ever have sex.</br>
</p>
<p>
What are you talking about?</br>
</p>
<p>
I want a divorce.</br>
</p>
<p>
What do you mean,</br>you want a divorce?</br>
</p>
<p>
What's that supposed to mean,</br>you want a divorce?</br>
</p>
<p>
Get off me! I want a divorce.</br>
</p>
<p>
You just made love to me.</br>
</p>
<p>
What the fuck is wrong with you?</br>
</p>
<p>
I don't love you anymore, Jordan!</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, you don't love me?</br>
</p>
<p>
You don't love me anymore, huh?</br>
</p>
<p>
Well, isn't that just fucking</br>convenient for you!</br>
</p>
<p>
Now that I'm under</br>federal indictment,</br>
</p>
<p>
with an electronic bracelet</br>around my ankle,</br>
</p>
<p>
now you decide you don't</br>fucking love me anymore.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Is that right?</br>- No, no.</br>
</p>
<p>
What kind of person are you?</br>Tell me.</br>
</p>
<p>
You married me!</br>
</p>
<p>
What the fuck is that</br>supposed to mean?</br>
</p>
<p>
Jordan, this is how it's gonna go.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm gonna take custody of the kids.</br>
</p>
<p>
If you agree to the</br>divorce right now,</br>
</p>
<p>
I will allow visitation.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Okay? Don't try to fight it.</br>- Oh, my God.</br>
</p>
<p>
It'll save us both a lot of money</br>
</p>
<p>
and I got a feeling</br>you're gonna need it.</br>
</p>
<p>
You're not taking my kids,</br>sweetheart. You hear me?</br>
</p>
<p>
I've already talked to the lawyer.</br>
</p>
<p>
He said even if you</br>don't get convicted,</br>
</p>
<p>
I've got a good chance</br>of getting them.</br>
</p>
<p>
I got news for you.</br>
</p>
<p>
You're not fucking</br>taking my children,</br>
</p>
<p>
you vicious fucking cunt, you!</br>
</p>
<p>
Fuck you, you fucking bitch!</br>
</p>
<p>
You're not fucking taking</br>my goddamn fucking kids!</br>
</p>
<p>
You hear me? Fuck you!</br>
</p>
<p>
You're not fucking</br>taking my fucking kids!</br>
</p>
<p>
Fucking bitch!</br>
</p>
<p>
Fucking whore!</br>
</p>
<p>
Fucking bitch!</br>Piece of shit fucking whore!</br>
</p>
<p>
Look at yourself, Jordan.</br>
</p>
<p>
You're sick!</br>
</p>
<p>
You're a sick man!</br>
</p>
<p>
Fuck you! I told you,</br>you're not taking my fucking kids!</br>
</p>
<p>
You think I would let</br>my kids near you?</br>
</p>
<p>
Look at yourself!</br>
</p>
<p>
You know what my lawyer said?</br>
</p>
<p>
My lawyer said that you're going to</br>prison for 20 years, Jordan.</br>
</p>
<p>
Twenty fucking years! You're</br>never gonna see the kids again!</br>
</p>
<p>
You don't think I'm</br>not gonna see my...</br>
</p>
<p>
No, I'm not fucking</br>letting you near my kids!</br>
</p>
<p>
You don't think I'm gonna see</br>my fucking kids again, huh?</br>
</p>
<p>
Don't you fucking touch them!</br>
</p>
<p>
Don't you fucking touch me!</br>
</p>
<p>
Sweetheart? You're coming</br>on a trip with Daddy, all right?</br>
</p>
<p>
You're coming on a trip with Daddy.</br>
</p>
<p>
Don't you fucking touch her,</br>Jordan.</br>
</p>
<p>
I swear to God,</br>I will fucking kill you!</br>
</p>
<p>
It's all right, baby.</br>
</p>
<p>
You and Daddy are gonna go</br>
</p>
<p>
on a little trip together, okay?</br>
</p>
<p>
- A little trip together.</br>- Violet!</br>
</p>
<p>
Violet!</br>
</p>
<p>
- Get the key! Get the key!</br>- I got it!</br>
</p>
<p>
Jordan, you open this fucking door</br>
</p>
<p>
- right now! Open the door!</br>- Put your seat belt on.</br>
</p>
<p>
There you go. Get your legs in.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm taking her with me!</br>
</p>
<p>
I told you I'm taking her with me,</br>
</p>
<p>
you fucking bitch!</br>
</p>
<p>
You're not gonna stop me!</br>You're not gonna stop me!</br>
</p>
<p>
We're going on a</br>little trip, honey.</br>
</p>
<p>
No! No!</br>
</p>
<p>
Get the hell out of here!</br>
</p>
<p>
Leave that baby alone!</br>
</p>
<p>
Violet! Garage door! Close it!</br>
</p>
<p>
Mommy!</br>
</p>
<p>
- Get out of here!</br>- Open the fucking door!</br>
</p>
<p>
Mommy!</br>
</p>
<p>
No!</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, Lord! Oh, my heavens...</br>
</p>
<p>
Get the baby!</br>
</p>
<p>
Naomi, get the baby!</br>
</p>
<p>
- Mommy.</br>- Honey, it's okay.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's gonna be okay.</br>
</p>
<p>
Oh, Mr. Jordan has lost his mind.</br>
</p>
<p>
- Baby...</br>- It's all right, honey.</br>
</p>
<p>
She all right?</br>
</p>
<p>
Is she all right?</br>
</p>
<p>
What's the matter with you?</br>
</p>
<p>
Is she all right?</br>

Jordan, do you know how good it is</br>
</p>
<p>
to have you back in this office?</br>
</p>
<p>
It's not the same when you're gone.</br>
</p>
<p>
It's sad, you understand?</br>It's like...</br>
</p>
<p>
That fucking Steve Madden, huh?</br>
</p>
<p>
I can't...</br>
</p>
<p>
Swear to God, I can't</br>even think about it.</br>
</p>
<p>
Every time I think about him,</br>my blood boils.</br>
</p>
<p>
I can't even say his name.</br>
</p>
<p>
- I know.</br>- It's, like, disgusting.</br>
</p>
<p>
I grew up with this guy</br>and he betrays me like that.</br>
</p>
<p>
Ugh!</br>
</p>
<p>
He ever get back to</br>you about that, um...</br>
</p>
<p>
About that account?</br>
</p>
<p>
You remember.</br>
</p>
<p>
It was like 4 or 5 mil,</br>something like that, right?</br>
</p>
<p>
He was supposed</br>to kick back 4 or 5 mil, was it?</br>
</p>
<p>
Actually, I was...</br>
</p>
<p>
I was fucked up, Jordan,</br>
</p>
<p>
- so I don't really remember.</br>- Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, right. Stupid.</br>
</p>
<p>
Well, if he calls you,</br>
</p>
<p>
you make sure and contact me, okay?</br>
</p>
<p>
- Yeah. Of course.</br>- Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
Of course, yeah. No, of course.</br>
</p>
<p>
You gonna eat that last piece</br>of yellowtail, bud?</br>
</p>
<p>
No, it's all yours.</br>
</p>
<p>
Can I get this?</br>
</p>
<p>
So, what else is...</br>
</p>
<p>
Well, how's Naomi and everything?</br>
</p>
<p>
You know how it is.</br>
</p>
<p>
She hates my fucking guts.</br>
</p>
<p>
How's Hildy? Good?</br>
</p>
<p>
She's still alive, so</br>
</p>
<p>
my life is fucked, you know?</br>
</p>
<p>
Yeah.</br>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Jordan.</br>
</p>
<p>
Mmm?</br>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Jordan, you got a visitor.</br>
</p>
<p>
What?</br>
</p>
<p>
You've got a visitor.</br>
</p>
<p>
I need you to get dressed.</br>
</p>
<p>
Why? What the fuck's going on?</br>
</p>
<p>
You're going to jail.</br>
</p>
<p>
All right.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'll get some clothes on.</br>
</p>
<p>
We'll give you a hand with that.</br>
</p>
<p>
Okay.</br>
</p>
<p>
FBI!</br>
</p>
<p>
Everybody sit down. Put your hands</br>
</p>
<p>
where they can be seen,</br>and shut up!</br>
</p>
<p>
Don't you fucking touch me.</br>
</p>
<p>
Get your fucking hands off me!</br>
</p>
<p>
Don't get out of your seats!</br>
</p>
<p>
It's fucking Chanel!</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I gave up everyone.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>And in return,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I got three years in some hellhole</br>in Nevada I'd never even heard of.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Like my pops, Mad Max, had said,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>"The chickens had</br>come home to roost."</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Whatever the fuck that means.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I hope Your Honor would agree</i></br>
</p>
<p>
that Mr. Belfort has</br>distinguished himself</br>
</p>
<p>
in terms of his cooperation.</br>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Belfort has helped the</br>government win convictions</br>
</p>
<p>
of over two dozen serious offenders</br>
</p>
<p>
and helped them</br>recover millions of dollars</br>
</p>
<p>
to be made available</br>for restitution to their victims.</br>
</p>
<p>
The sentence of the court shall be</br>
</p>
<p>
36 months in federal prison.</br>
</p>
<p>
Please remand the defendant.</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm sorry.</br>
</p>
<p>
That's okay.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I'm not ashamed to admit it.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>When we arrived at the prison,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I was absolutely terrified.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
Belfort, on your feet.</br>
</p>
<p>
<i>But I needn't have been.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>You see, for a brief</br>fleeting moment,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I 'd forgotten I was rich.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>And I lived in a place</br>where everything was for sale.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Wouldn't you like to</br>learn how to sell it?</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>So listen. I've met some</br>bad motherfuckers in my life.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I'm talking about rock stars,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>professional athletes, gangsters.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>I'm telling you,</br>some real bad motherfuckers.</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>But this guy, my good friend,</i></br>
</p>
<p>
<i>Mr. Jordan Belfort, is the single</i></br>
</p>
<p>
baddest motherfucker</br>I have ever met.</br>
</p>
<p>
So I want you right now</br>
</p>
<p>
to give a warm Auckland,</br>New Zealand welcome</br>
</p>
<p>
for my good friend</br>
</p>
<p>
